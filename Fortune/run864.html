     COLOR="#ff00ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR CLEAR="ALL"></FONT><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">An elite few arrived
    at the Mountbatten Centre car park to be greeted by Donkey<BR>
    promising an experience never had before in the history of hashing!
    He led us to a shed<BR>
    full of rubber suits, some of which were wet and dripping - were
    we about to assist<BR>
    Donkey in carrying out some kind of rubber-suited fantasy? As
    there were no cameras in evidence we didn't appear to be helping
    to make an erotic movie! He then insisted we<BR>
    don brightly coloured buoyancy aids and we advanced onto the
    pontoon.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We waited on
    the pontoon for ages - Euthanasia managed to pass some of the
    time by<BR>
    indulging in a passionate embrace with a strange man - until
    Donkey and another man<BR>
    (whose name I don't know) drove up in bright orange safety boats.
    We all clambered<BR>
    aboard and were sped across the wild and windy waves to Bovisand.
    Everyone seemed to enjoy the boat trip except for Beth who was
    trying to put her head under any available<BR>
    person! We jumped out of the boats into a couple of feet of water
    (after all, a hash isn't a hash without getting wet!!!), ran
    ashore and commenced the run.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Apart from the
    thousands of steps (well, a lot anyway) the run was picturesque
    with<BR>
    magnificent views across the Sound to Plymouth Hoe on a lovely
    sunny evening. We<BR>
    dashed up the steps (well. Zippy and Plodder did anyway!) and
    then staggered down over the rocks - luckily the tide was out
    - which also involved a certain use of mountaineering skills.
    Mudflaps found out that her legs were too short to clamber down
    some of the rocks and, in the absence of a grow bag, she accepted
    assistance from Anonymouse who was being a hero to the dainty
    Hashettes! Whilst on the beach Yakkidah was seen examining lumps
    of rotten wood but decided they were too big to carry with her
    - another fantasy trying to be fulfilled?</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Donkey had assured
    us that, if we were on, we were on which did cause us some<BR>
    confusion when we found arrows pointing us back the way we had
    come!! And, just<BR>
    when we thought it was all over. Donkey re-appeared (having gone
    off earlier in the boat)<BR>
    and took us back to &quot;that&quot; shed and made us carry canoes
    down to the water. Plodder did his super hero performance and
    carried one on his own! The three boats raced around the pontoon
    - rowed valiantly by people more used to exercising their legs!
    - and was easily won by Plodder, Yakki and Euthanasia. Zippy
    tipped a boat over (presumably because he hadn't won) plummeting
    Dishy into the sea. However Dishy got her own back as, whilst
    appearing to be making it up with Zippy, she whipped his shorts
    down revealing his all. We didn't have any binoculars with us
    so couldn't really see very well! Zippy seemed to enjoy this
    - maybe his secret fantasy is to be compulsorily exposed to the
    world!!</FONT></P>

     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">VERSION 2<BR CLEAR="ALL"></FONT></B><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The car park at Mountbatten
    contained a motley collection of Drake Hashers looking<BR>
    apprehensive as Donkey strutted around in his bloc shades trying
    to impress the<BR>
    hashettes and Meg. To counter last weeks rumour Zippy turned
    in the same van as<BR>
    Plodder with not a Mermaid in sight........</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">After some debate
    Donkey announced that our minder for the evening would be Ali
    who promptly led us onto the jetty, here we stood exchanging
    sea stories until our hare arrived to collect us for a trip to
    Bovisand by boat. Here we were dumped on the beach,or more precisely
    about 20 meters off the beach to the disgust of Mudflaps and
    our hare sped offback to the Mountbatten bar whilst shouting,
    &quot; Stick with Ali&quot;.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Then followed a run back along the coast path.
    At the long/short split Dishy and Mole led most of the pack after
    Zippy on the long,claiming she didn't want to miss the view from
    the top. The long's came blundering out of the undergrowth to
    ruin the peace of a couple sitting quietly on a bench enjoying
    the view. Here the pack joined Ali and Teef back on the footpath.
    Eventually we ended up on a beach combing / rambling stroll across
    the beach with Yakki collecting driftwood.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Back at Mountbatten Donkey had another treat
    as the final sting in the tail........ A canoe race around the
    jetty......The pace was set by Yakki, Euthanasia and Plodder
    leaving Team Beast and Team Zip floundering in their wake...
    even after a desperate attempt by Zip to swim ashore to the finish
    line. In desperation Zip was reduced to taking his crew for a
    swim which Mole managed to avoid by leaping ashore ...... Dishy
    wasn't fast enough and is now known as FISHY.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    At the bar ZIPP announced that he is a technical virgin ????
    For more info. See Zip.<BR>
    Thanks Martin and Ali ........apparently Donkey helped as well!!!!!!!<BR>
    <B>ON ON.....</B></FONT></P>
