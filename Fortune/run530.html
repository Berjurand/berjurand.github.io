    I made it back for one hash and very good it was too! We, a merry
    band of hashers set off from Davey's Cross moorgate, and after
    spending most of the hash struggling our way up a very steep
    slope in the teeth of a gale, in the last ten minutes proceeded
    to run back down it again. Using a mixture of cunning and dastardly
    trail laying, and no trail at all, we were kept together all
    the way. This is in contrast, I am informed (and this is hearsay
    and only alleged by the majority of the hash) to my parents Anonymouse
    &amp; Mudflaps' efforts the week before. On that occasion, the
    trail laying was so confused that at one point even the map had
    to come out in an attempt to find the way back.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">When a steaming bowl of carbonara was pushed in front
    of me in the pub after the run, ten weeks of cooking for myself
    on a student grant (which is going to be cut next year by the
    theiving Tory bastards) was forgotten and I ate. Minutes later
    Begorrah returned from the bar to find me eating his meal. Well,
    I was hungry and these mistakes happen. Anyway, he dutifully
    received my identical carbonara at the same time as my parents
    - last, that is.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">At intervals,
    I noticed various hash members were sneaking off for longer periods
    than were warranted for merely visiting the toilet. So I asked
    Deadly what was going on. In hushed tones I was informed that
    there was a &quot;bit of a looker&quot; in the next bar, and
    all the dirty old (and young) men of the hash, who until then
    I had only perceived as each having their own personal halo,
    had been disappearing to snatch quick glimpses of this, and I
    quote &quot;delicious creature&quot;.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Anyway,
    the music the musicians in the pub were playing was lively, even
    though the sceptics were dubious of its Irishness. Many hash
    members, usually quiet and reserved people (!) joined the rowdy
    rabble dancing to 'Donald Where's Your Troooooousers'. I did
    notice one particularly dodgy bloke getting rather carried away
    with his dancing to the point where his movements could be construed
    as being improper, if not downright indecent. I don't know, what
    is the older generation coming to?<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">In
    conclusion, I'd like to dedicate this hash mag to Schweppes -
    so you've all got to buy him a drink. No, not a half, he wants
    a whole pint - and not lemonade!</FONT></P>
