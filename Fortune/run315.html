    is more of a hash mag than that was a hash run. What a hash up,
    and in front of<BR>
    a bus-load of first time hashers, too! Are they called Greenies?<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">In fact, having spoken personally to the hares
    only the previous weekend to confirm that<BR>
    they were laying the run, it did not seem possible at first that
    we were following a<BR>
    phantom trail set several days/weeks earlier by a rival hash.
    Unfortunate circumstances<BR>
    had prevented our hares from laying the trail, but there was
    no excusing that unmentionable Drake H3 hare, who not only failed
    to inform the Chief Hare of their inablity to lay, but also went
    on a rival hash trail for the night. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">However,
    the Drake H3 stalwarts and super keenies did an excellent cover
    up job. Farting Ferret set the tone by leading across an icy
    river which claimed the first Greenie causing him to lose his
    torch. The trail looped and double-looped, Drake H3 calling &quot;On
    On&quot; and the Greenies calling &quot;Where? Where?&quot;.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">We came to a leat. Most of Drake, skilled at
    long-jumping in the dark, took it in their stride, although IAT
    was heard down to our right calling &quot;Short this way&quot;
    to no avail, since almost everyone, Greenies and Keenies alike,
    was eager to jump the leat. Smutty and a couple of other spoilsports
    took the trouble to find a bridge across. None of the Greenies
    gave in, nor did Alastair's wife, whose name I cannot spell.
    One by one they launched themselves, and one by one they slipped
    on the edge and went in. In fact, only three of them avoided
    getting wet, which was less than could be said for our esteemed
    scribe. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Hobbling along with a
    pulled calf muscle and therefore unable to jump the leat, I fully
    expected Endosperm to play the dutiful husband and help me to
    walk on water. No such luck. There I was, up to my waist in water
    whilst he went charging away with the Keenies up the hill. The
    Greenies had taken so long crossing the leat, since they all
    waited for each other, that the Drake H3 Keenies were on the
    way back down the hill, which resulted in an unscheduled regroup.</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The
    hash was united briefly, we soon divided company to cross the
    raison d'etre of Drake H3's existence - bogs, muck, mire and
    swamps. Cavorting from tussock to tussock, I realised that most
    of the Greenies were following me. It is good for the soul to
    hear comments such as &quot;Follow her, it's safe that way....she
    knows where she's going!&quot;. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Just
    then then, a Greenie tried to elevate himself to the ranks of
    the Super-Keenies. He wore a heavy tracksuit with a full length,
    thunderstorm-proof anorak and would have made an excellent stand-in
    for I'm Not Norman. So what did he do? Tried to overtake me,
    and within three paces, no joking, was up to his armpits in the
    bog! Then I realised, that he lacked one of I'm Not Norman's
    vital survival techniques: This chap could not get out and was
    still going down. He reached an arm out and I could just grab
    his finger-tips. He sunk deeper still. It is actually quite interesting
    seeing just how quickly a person can subside in a bog. We had
    mutual rush of panic, l grabbed his lapels, he kicked madly and
    with a lot of squalling noises ( just like when my wisdom tooth
    was extracted last week) out he came. Suddenly it seemed hilarious,
    I could not stop laughing all the way back to the cars.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    It must be recorded that Rover was heard whingeing tonight. What
    about? The fact<BR>
    that a bus-load of Greenies drank all the hash beer and didn't
    leave him any. I hate to<BR>
    see a grown man cry!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The on-down was at the White Thorn, Shaugh Prior.
    Deadly confirmed our suspicions that he was going senile, in
    fact had gone senile and regressed into his second childhood.
    Not only did he lose his car keys and wallet (which cost Limpalong
    a Coca Cola to redeem), not only did he frisk all the likely
    females in the area, not only did he pat IAT on the cheeks (facial)
    to see if he had false teeth, not only did he nick the<BR>
    Greenies' chips, he even climbed up on the seats and tried to
    scale the partitioning armed with an offensive weapon to stab
    at more chips. Doubtless, suffering the amnesia so common with
    senility, he will not remember any of this.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Alongside Deadly's antics, Smutty and Farting
    Ferret were in loud conversation about<BR>
    a hapless female who had arrived at the hash only to find that
    the company was not<BR>
    what she expected and drove away again. Well, the topic of conversation
    was mundane enough, but it was Smutty's body language whilst
    talking about nubile females that was so loud, or does he suffer
    from a nervous twitch down there? Certainly Farting Ferret could
    not keep a straight face.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Cream Sod was with us again, and he produced
    a hash mag for us to peruse. But whatever was all that rambling
    on about his filofax? And where has he put it this week? Don't
    miss next week's exciting episode. By the way, Cream Sod is an
    expert instructor in laying - he'll show you how to do it and
    can always guarantee a good lay. Full satisfaction or your money
    back - just ask Cream Sod!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Alastair properly introduced his wife to us,
    but I still can't spell her name. She has given up squashing
    for hashing. With all those fit female newcomers to the hash
    we are a dead cert of win the Ladies Albaston Relay trophy again!</FONT></P>
