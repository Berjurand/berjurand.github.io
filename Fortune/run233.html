     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Probably the highlight of the run was
    arriving back at the Swan, and finding that wheels, VW badges,
    aerials, and other detachable parts, had not been removed from
    hashers' vehicles. Even the windscreens were intact, and not
    a single bonnet had &quot;I love Johnny&quot; scratched onto
    it. What a revelation! Despite appearances, perhaps this area
    of Plymouth isn't so bad after all.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">It
    is difficult to know what to write about the run. By laying the
    trail in chalk, the hare had ascribed greater powers of observation
    to the hash-pack than were evident on Monday evening, and so
    many delicate and witty parts were missed out. However, we<BR>
    must be thankful that enough chalk was spotted to keep the majority
    of runners together. The route climbed from sea-level up and
    down, and round and round, to Stoke and the highest spot in Plymouth,
    which affords not only views of the surrounding moors, but also
    of more terraced housing than an entire series of Coronation
    Street.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">From there, it was steeply
    downhill and uphill, through alleys etc.... Around this point
    we met up with Breakaway Group Number One - Endosperm, Deerhunter
    et al, who had missed a huge arrow somewhere at the bottom of
    Devonport Park. They had been around Stonehouse and other way-off-target
    areas and, curiously, had got the idea that the hash was making
    its way to the Barbican, before they eventually succeeded in
    finding the end of the trail and following it backwards.<BR 
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Not long after this, splinter Group
    Number Two did his own thing, but as it's now the third week
    in a row this has happened, it was not entirely unexpected. What
    IS Farting Ferret up to????? A breakaway Hash for singles???,
    or a secret assignation??? Hashing provides the perfect cover
    - &quot;See you next week, same time, same sweat...&quot;.<BR>
    Chaps, we must monitor his steps carefully from now on, it all
    seems rather sinister to me! His claims that he 'thought' the
    hash was making its way up to Central Park are slightly far-fetched,
    as it was in totally the opposite direction to the On-Down.<BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Oh well, on to the On Down, where
    we were entertained by Kamikaze kids hurtling down the steep
    streets on skateboards, using their toughened hands as brakes
    on the cobblestones! Rather them than me, as this is an area
    of Plymouth where foul dogs<BR>
    roam wild, totally ignoring Mrs Thatcher's anti-litter campaign.<BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">As the sun began to set, and it became
    dangerous to remain in the none-too-well-lit streets, we made
    for the security of the Swan where a wealth of real-ale and gossip
    was to be had. Actually, not so much of the gossip, more of the
    pleas for help: Firstly, there was Jon 'The Action-Man' wanting
    a volunteer to type his C.V., but nobody seemed keen. Knowing
    the details of his background and how he evolved into what he
    is today, it would be, well, one helluva psychological battering
    to commit oneself to. It would probably involve several pints
    of Tippex too - and that just to spell John jon Jon correctly!!<BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Then there was Woodenlegs appealing
    for volunteers to lay runs while she takes three months annual
    leave in Canada. As she takes the Hare-Mistress role seriously
    (!) she is desperate to fill up those dates when she'll be absent.
    NO HARE = NO RUN so come on folks!!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Next,
    it was Nursey's turn - her need was more basic though......!
    She just wants MONEY!!! All for a worthy cause, though I forget
    precisely which one it is. Well they're all worthy aren't they?
    The idea is to sponsor her a certain amount for every pound she
    loses by September. Ha! That's bloody easy!! She could start
    by taking us all out to dinner &quot;Chips all round please....&quot;.
    That should get rid of a few quid.... What? ..... Oh!... lbs!!
    Oh well, definitely no chips, or any dinner at all for that matter.
    She was overheard asking if tonic water was on tap at the Swan!
    &quot;Just connecting up a new barrel madam...&quot;. So folks,
    offer her your calorie-free donations and she'll reveal to you
    her starting weight!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">One of Nursey's
    first donations came from the resident pub entertainer - he proffered
    ten pence, but I would gladly have given him double that NOT
    to sing, as he whined almost as much as Jimmy the dog after a
    Farting Armpit ticking-off session. Luckily, he didn't<BR>
    begin &quot;singing&quot; until almost closing time - perhaps
    this is the Swan's equivalent of shouting &quot;Last Orders Please&quot;
    and dimming the lights.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">One of
    the final pleas came from organisers of the barbecue on May 30th,
    at Clearbrook. It must be stressed that WHATEVER THE WEATHER
    (ie. even if, as is normal on a Bank Holiday, it is pouring),
    there will be barbecues lit and awaiting your juicy steaks, sausages,
    suckling pigs, marshmallows etc. when you return from the run,
    and you'll be able to eat your favourite burnt food without discomfort
    (unless you eat too much), or any need for umbrella and wellies.
    So for gawd's sake start saving now for a bit o' rump!!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">Well, that's about it chaps. There are many dedicated
    hashers who haven't got a mention this week, and the normal well-deserved
    scathing remarks are absent, but then HE wasn't running this
    time. Blissfully peaceful it was too.....</FONT></P>
