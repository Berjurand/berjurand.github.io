    laid, perfectly timed run at eight-thirty precisely they saw
    red too. Discontented grumbles of &quot;Wasted flour&quot; were
    heard.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">So it was not a happy lot
    who entered the Moorland Hotel at Wotter.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">Inside, however, things brightened up. IAT was trying
    to give away some dusters in red, yellow and grey colours with
    mis-spelt words printed on them, claiming they were souvenirs
    of last week's momentous 700th run.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR

    suffered the rounds of abuse as she bravely tried to collect
    &pound;1 from each hasher.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Not
    Norman almost took his jeans off to show how well his eight year
    old scar had healed but was deterred by the look of shock on
    Twice-A-Week's face.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">This week's
    division of tables seemed to based on height. It you were six
    feet tall or more you grouped on the left, leaving all the dwarves
    on the right. Why is it that all the tall blokes such as Fferret,
    Wimpers, Rover, Sub, Deadly (and sometimes IAT) get in huddle
    round the bar so that everyone else gets neck-ache trying to
    talk up to them? How about putting them all in a team for the
    Albaston Relays and calling them 'Drake's Runner-Beans'?. Dress
    them all in green tights and they could win the Fancy Dress prize
    for the fastest fancy dress Team!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Skippy
    was not there for Deadly to victimise and since the rest of the
    Harriettes present could hold their own against him, he picked
    on IAT instead. &quot;What's this GRID REF&quot; he roared. &quot;It's
    all wrong, you've put the numbers back to front&quot;. It took
    Rudolph to produce a map to explain to the Old Queen that the
    runs were thirty miles apart before he was convinced that the
    references were correct.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">IAT was
    happily eating his rubber pasty, discussing the merits of aged
    Grand Masters who were still mobile and somehow became the butt
    of a joke. He added that in his case GM did not stand for Grand
    Master but for Grey Matter! Ha! Ha! <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Anonymouse
    and Mudflaps sat in shell-shocked silence tonight. At the start
    of the hash (the bit where it was going OK) everyone turned west,
    leaving Mudflaps walking up the public footpath. Suddenly a nasty,
    bully-boy farmer appeared and shouted at li'l ole Mudflaps and
    threatened to blow her head off with his shotgun. It was most
    unfair, she was not running with loose dogs or chasing his pregnant
    ewes, so he should be charged with assault, threatening behaviour
    and carrying an offensive weapon in public. <BR CLEAR="ALL">SO
    WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?!!!</FONT></P>
