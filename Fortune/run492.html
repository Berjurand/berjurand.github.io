     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A large pack of hash
    hounds met by the moorgate at Davey's Cross, Ivybridge, to sample
    Yokelbonker's final trail for Drake H3 before he is transferred
    to Portsmouth.<BR>
    He says that he will particularly miss Dartmoor - where else
    would the warders let him<BR>
    out on Monday nights?<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">The trail
    took the hounds around a disused quarry before heading out onto
    the lower<BR>
    slopes of Western Beacon. An intricate series of loops successfully
    kept the hash together, until F. Ferret decided that ten minutes
    continuous running was more than enough for anybody and disappeared
    in the direction of the cars. Later in the pub he tried to persuade
    sceptical listeners that he had been following sawdust all the
    way, and had finished up on top of the Beacon. His manner was
    so plausible that he nearly ended up convincing himself.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The remainder of the hash followed the sawdust
    in the direction of Harford moor before<BR>
    returning on a disused railway track, known locally as the 'Puffing
    Billy' - presumably<BR>
    in honour of Cream Soda. Begorrah relates that when he found
    himself bringing up the rear on the track he experienced one
    of those magical moments when the wind ceases and a mystical
    stillness descends. Such moments seem strangely significant,
    as if you listen closely you may hear the music of the spheres,
    the voice of creation.Unforunately &quot;Bloody Road Run&quot;
    was all Begorrah heard, as it drifted across the valley.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">From the track the trail led uphill to the top
    of Western Beacon. It was here that several<BR>
    hashers were amazed to encounter a Landrover lurching towards
    them out of the darkness. Judging by the angle at which it was
    leaning and its erratic progress, the vehicle could only be driven
    by a lunatic joyrider with a deathwish on a one way trip to oblivion,
    or a hasher. As the driver turned out to be Mimi it is difficult
    to know which description is the most appropriate.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The explanation as to how a Landrover got to
    be on top of a Dartmoor tor in the dark<BR>
    would seem to present a puzzle worthy of the reasoning powers
    of Sherlock Holmes. It is a fair bet on this occasion Holmes
    would be stumped for an explanation, because<BR>
    Mimi and IAT were involved, therefore reason would certainly
    have no bearing in the matter. Both Mimi, as driver, and IAT,
    as navigator, have their own distinct versions of the events<B>
    </B>that caused them to be where they were, and both versions
    have been published to help the reader reach his or her own conclusions:</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">MIMI: It was
    IAT's fault, he told me to go up the wrong lane.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">IAT: It was Mimi's fault, he was late so there
    was no time to check out the start.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">MIMI: When we realised we were at the wrong place
    IAT suggested a long detour by road which meant we would miss
    most of the hash. The sensible thing to do was to take a short
    cut across the moor.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">IAT: When we realised we were at the wrong place
    I suggested a short detour by road which meant we would not miss
    most of the hash. It would be crazy to cut across the moor.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">MIMI: I drove carefully over the moor, and luckily
    I've got extensive off road experience, so I could safely negotiate
    the rough terrain.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">IAT: He drove like a lunatic over the moor, nearly
    turning the Landrover over.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">MIMI: By systematically searching the hillside
    I discovered the hash.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">lAT: He drove around blindly, eventually blundering
    across the hash by luck.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">MIMI: I made a carefully controlled descent to
    the start where the hare was waiting to open the gate.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">IAT: He careered down the hillside, and the hare
    only just opened the gate before we<BR>
    crashed through it! <BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">(The above reads something like the libretto
    of a Gilbert &amp; Sullivan operetta, perhaps someone could set
    it to music! On second thoughts.......).<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">At the start of his little escapade Mimi had
    gotten out of the Landrover and ran off down the hillside looking
    for the hash. Instead of making contact with the runners he made
    contact with a large and particularly ferocious rock, hurting
    his leg in the process. As a result, he could only use one foot
    to work the Landrover's foot pedals. This made quite an impression
    on IAT - anyway, white hair quite suits him.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Muscles, Dishy &amp; Yakkidah told of how they
    were offered a lift in the Landrover. As soon as they tried to
    get in it drove off in the wrong direction, with Mimi and lAT
    shouting &quot;On On&quot; at the top of their voices. The harriettes
    should have known better - didn't their mothers tell then about
    not accepting lifts from strange men? (And you couldn't get much
    stranger than those two).<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">After the excitement had died down Cream Soda
    found himself alone on Western Beacon where he trail was proving
    elusive. Suddenly the peace was shattered by what sounded like
    a Jumbo jet taking off directly below. It tumed out to be HT2
    calling on, how come someone so small can make so much noise?
    With practice, perhaps?<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Back at the cars two locals in a pickup truck
    were seen talking to Endosperm. They told him that a thirteen
    stone Rottweiler had recently escaped from a nearby house and
    was thought to be on the loose up on the moor, where the Police
    were out looking for it.<BR>
    Apparently they had heard that the hash was in the area and were
    concerned for the<BR>
    Rottweiler's safety.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The on down was at the Anchor Inn, Ugborough.
    The hash was moved from the public bar when the musicians playing
    there complained that Deadly was drowning out their amplification.
    Deadly and Rover insisted that they were the only people to do
    the whole trail so keeping to the story they had concocted between
    them on the telephone the previous night.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Slo-Jo revealed that her dog Algie had recently
    chewed her arm off. Luckily the rest of<BR>
    the chair was undamaged. Zippy was seen toasting his success
    (2nd place) in the Bodmin Five Tors race, with Paul enthusiastically
    helping him. It seems that Paul is to be given the hash name
    'First &amp; Last', but on the available evidence perhaps 'Thirstyglass'
    would be more fitting.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The society wedding of the year between Bart
    &amp; Katmandu took place the previous Saturday. Look out for
    the photographs in 'The Tatler', 'Devon Life' &amp; 'The Donkey
    Breeder's Gazette'. The newlyweds would like to thank everyone
    in the hash for the present and card.They are sure the Morris
    Minor starting handle and the nosehair clippers will come in
    very handy, and the plastic gnome has pride of place on the mantelpiece.
    Someone else's mantelpiece.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Yokelbonker
    was suitably surprised when a large cake baked in his honour
    was brought out. This was a 'Thank You' for all the trails he
    has laid for Drake and to wish him good luck in Portsmouth. It
    was plain to see that Yokelbonker was touched - well you have
    to be a bit touched to be a hasher, don't you? As he cut the
    cake he found it hard to hold back the tears, then someone told
    him that he didn't have to pay for it and he immediately cheered
    up. Good luck Yokelbonker, hope to see you again soon!</FONT></P>

    Police are looking for two joyriders after a thirteen stone Rottweiler
    was run over and<BR>
    flattened on Western Beacon on Monday night. Landrover tracks
    were found leading away from the scene of the accident. The joyriders
    are believed to be in their early seventies and bear a striking
    resemblance to Laurel &amp; Hardy.</FONT></P>
