    CLEAR="ALL"></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Is
    this a record throughout the Hashing world? Only involved for
    two weeks and then privileged to be 'asked' to scribe! Only Skippy
    would have the temerity to make such a proposition to a novice
    so early in his career. What are my thoughts after participating
    in just two hashes? {In actual fact, it is two and a half hashes.
    I managed to arrive at Laployd Plantation just as everyone else
    was finishing. Not to miss out, I went on my own course, finding
    several random (mystic?) piles of sawdust. Fishermen around the
    reservoir were still recovering their composure after the tranquility
    of the early evening had been destroyed by the joyous cries of
    &quot;On On&quot; plus the other specialist phrases peculiar
    to hashers. Maybe, one day, these anglers will recover. Maybe.
    This was my first sight of human flesh and various artifacts
    of clothing left dangling from thorn bushes. This Is fun?)<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Well, there were thirteen years of studiously
    avoiding being involved with any of the local Hash House Harriers
    - being associated with the reputation hashes have for craziness
    and buffoonery would have been a severe handicap in progressing
    my staid career in financial management. Now, after just two
    weeks, I see life in a different light:<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">I have lost my hash virginity.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">I am tainted<I>.</I><BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">I will never be the same!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">There is probably no redemption - all seems lost.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The Great Harrier has me in his/her grasp!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">How could I succumb? It was the intoxication
    of barbeque smoke, a Drake H3 sweat-shirt, sported by the fern-lover
    (you guessed, Skippy). The smoke made me thirsty, then brown
    nectar quenched my thirst but made me a bit tipsy. I spied the
    H3 sweat-shirt through the hazy smoke.............and all resolve
    was lost.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">So, onto my first official run. Over a moor,
    in a bog, across a road, in a bog (will my leg ever come out?
    will my trainers still be on my feet?), up a tor, across a leat.
    Puff, pant, pant. Nearly managed to speak whilst running! Accepted
    the strong advice, given with a knowing smile, to take the short
    run back. Introduced to some fleshy athlete tinkling a bell.
    &quot;What's my name?&quot; she asks. No oxygen, cannot think.
    &quot;Tinkerbell&quot;. So bloody obvious, under normal circumstances.
    Sense of achievement and satisfaction at the end. More friendliness
    in the social arena. I reckon this is the regular local watering
    hole because locals in the local hardly bat an eyelid at us (or
    are they just as mad, but in a different sort of way?). Severe
    aches and pains through the week make it seem too much of a sacrifice.
    Maybe I would have saved my sanity, but come the Monday, the
    kit is adorned and off to Brisworthy Plantation. Went to the
    farm first and then just managed to avoid Wild Bill in a shower
    of dirt and dust who'd also made the wrong assumption. Soon found
    the tribe and then it's off. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">A
    selection of real novices tonight, one with one and a half hash
    experience along with two or three real novices! &quot;Follow
    the sawdust&quot; I say, displaying my full knowledge of tactics
    in one short breath. A beautiful run, up long drags of hills,
    mounting tors, crossing rivers deeper than I'd ever come across
    before. All performed like an octagenerian tortoise. Managed
    to get well separated from the pack when, blindly following advice
    of ????? who <I>'</I>knew' which way the trail was likely to
    go, except it didn't. Oh, the peace of being alone on the open
    moor. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Would you believe that
    a solitary marine, complete with full back-pack and a sizeable
    portion of the stores from Bickleigh or Stonehouse barracks was
    wandering aimlessly around, lost like a little lamb, desperately
    searching for the quickest route to Chivenor. I thought when
    we all grouped up at one point that we would observe the space
    spectacular from Jupiter. But no - On, On!! Actually held a mini-conversation
    whilst moving - must be improving. But keep being asked if I'm
    alright? What the hell do I look like? Apparently our route took
    us to ...................................... over to ................down
    to ....................... along .................... and finally
    back to the start. Marvellous, especially downhill. Learned a
    bit about 'checking'. That such deviousness should emanate from
    the mind of wo/man.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The social pairings were in full evidence afterwards.
    Someone was presented with a pair of mudflaps for some obscure
    reason. Reckon the wrapping cost more than the mudflaps. Must
    not do anything silly to prompt being christened with a new name.
    Well, after just two and a half hashes and being a scribe, I
    feel .............. knackered, exhilarated, bewildered, stunned
    and a teeny bit fitter. Will I ever recover from falling into
    the clutches of Drake H3?!!</FONT></P>
