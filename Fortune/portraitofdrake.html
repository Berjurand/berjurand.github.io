    every Monday evening at 7.30pm. Braving the fogs, bogs and ghostly
    dogs of Dartmoor, England (the setting for the Sherlock Holmes
    story 'The Hound Of The Baskervilles'), we set off on the trail
    of sawdust....<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Drake H3 is an
    off-road hash - we don't run on roads! But we don't need to,
    because we are very lucky to live near Dartmoor - a large area
    of wild moorland in the south west of England. Most of our trails
    are laid on the moor, but we often head for the coast and run
    along the coastal footpaths and around the estuaries. It's a
    hashers paradise! See for yourself by going to </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"

     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A HREF="onthetrail.html">On The Trail</A></FONT><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> to see a typical Drake
    H3 run. You don't have to be super fit to run with us, being
    able to jog is enough as there are plenty of shortcuts. Because
    we run at 7.30pm all the year round, it means that in the winter
    we have to use torches. Head torches are very popular, and so
    the hash often resembles a miners' convention. It's great to
    run in the company of a group of eccentrics that can almost make
    you seem normal by comparison.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Although
    our membership has gradually changed over the years, the hash
    has stayed much the same size with between ten and thirty runners
    turning up on a regular basis. Drake H3 membership consists of
    men, women and dogs. The dogs are welcome as long as they keep
    their owners under control. The atmosphere is very friendly,
    laid back and easygoing. Unlike some hashes, we don't go in for

    the run.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Drake was 'born' on 23
    January 1984 when the club had its first run. The runners who
    formed Drake H3 had previously hashed with Tamar Valley H3 which
    was started in 1982. Tamar Valley was (and still is) a great
    success often with around a hundred runners turning up. It has
    been said that Drake H3 was set up because of the length of time
    it took to get served at the bar after a Tamar Valley H3 run!
    However, our founder members, who are known as </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"
     FACE="Arial"><A HREF="drakesparents.html">Drake's Parents</A></FONT><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">, sometimes try to convince
    people that Drake H3 was created to concentrate on off-road hashing.
    The close ties between the two clubs were acknowledged by Drake
    H3 continuing to call itself 'Son Of Tamar Valley H3' for several
    years after it was formed.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Cream Soda was the person
    who we have to blame for starting the hash and for dreaming up
    the name of Drake for it. He named it after the famous British
    naval hero </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A HREF="sirfrancisdrake.html">Sir
    Francis Drake</A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">
    who was born and lived in west Devon. In fact, the club was originally
    known as Drake's Hash House Harriers but was converted to Drake
    when someone left the 's' off when writing the hash mag.<BR 
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Drake H3 is still going strong. Over
    the years we've had plenty of thrills and spills, pain and pleasure,
    laughter and tears, good times and ....... Come to think of it
    there's only good times on the hash. So why not try it yourself?

    be most welcome. The </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A
