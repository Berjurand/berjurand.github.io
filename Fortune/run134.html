    many happy returns to Cream Soda who celebrated his fifty third
    birthday on the hash, proving he wasn't over the hill having
    done the Haytor race on the day before and still managing a few
    moor tops yet. However, his &quot;On On&quot; calls were fading
    towards the end of the hash, and later he was seen falling off
    his seat...<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">After a boring bit on a path south of the Plume
    of Feathers, Princetown, the trail set off across a field covered
    in foot-high grass. According to Morris Minor &amp; Snakehips,
    the field was flat about two weeks before the hash, but this
    was little consolation to the hounds who were by now confused
    by seemingly random calls of &quot;On On&quot;. Eventually,<BR>
    someone found a check-in at the stone and some sort of order
    (?) was restored.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">I was disappointed that Horse-Trough wasn't there.
    After what he did to Morris-Minor's car, I would have enjoyed
    helping him into the nearest bog. Perhaps a better punishment
    for him would have been to make him run round with I.A.T. Having
    introduced a friend to the hash (what does he do to his enemies?),
    I.A.T. promptly<BR>
    lived up to his name by taking him on a short-cut and arriving
    back at the On-Down a quarter of an hour later than the main
    hash. He claims that the heather was much prettier on his route
    and the delay was blamed on stopping to pick flowers. All his
    friend could do was to keep repeating &quot;I enjoyed that&quot;
    (perhaps we could call him I.E.T.).</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The
    hash had more than it's fair share of bogs and Dinner-Jacket
    (DJ) showed the advantages of living locally by staying out of
    the more squelchy bits. To be fair, I hold nothing against the
    man, especially as he bought drinks for Morris-Minor and myself.<BR>
    On the return half of the excursion, Snakehips decided that the
    visibility had dropped enough to justify stopping for a head
    count, although the purpose of this was unclear because once
    he reached fifteen he just said &quot;Oh, well, that'll do&quot;
    and sped off once more into the fog. Was he just hiding the fact
    that he can't count beyond fifteen? He was certainly taking a
    long time to count the hash cash later in the evening.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The events of the evening seem to have been dominated
    by dogs. A red-setter appeared half-way round and attacked several
    hounds including I.A.T. &amp; I.E.T. on their short cut. Hubcaps
    brought along two fine-looking canines, both looking spick &amp;
    span, and she<BR>
    spent most of the evening trying to keep them out of the water.
    This she managed very well until she was almost home when they
    simultaneously made a bee-line for the nearest mud-pool and decided
    to have a bath (and severely reprimanded for it they were, too).
    <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">At the On Down, Jimmy decided
    to confirm his status as a Doberman against two fairly<BR>
    wimpish-looking mutts and someone was heard to shout &quot;I'll
    have a tenner on the black one!&quot; ( I have it on good authority
    that this is nothing unusual for an On-Down). Non-u-Sara very
    diplomatically said that the hash was very good except for the
    boggy bits ... you mean there were some non-boggy bits? Anyway,
    see you all at the next hash. Don't forget what a very wise man
    once said ....... &quot;Don't Panic!&quot;.</FONT></P>
