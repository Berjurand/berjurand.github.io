     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dinnaton at Ivybridge was a new location
    for Drake to start from, with the run being disorganised by Chalk
    Wallahs Chris and Hugh of Plympton H3. Whilst putting out his
    cigarette (he's in strict training), Hugh announced to the assembled
    twenty eight hashers that there were two runs; the long being
    seven miles and the short three miles. No problem for me deciding
    which to run with my injury (see pages 3, 4 and 5 for a fuller
    explanation, graphs and diagrams). <BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Returning visitors, Judy and Ray from St Albans,
    pranced expectantly - they're friends of Hubcaps - at least they
    were before this run started. There were also some new runners;
    Marcus and Matthew from Milton Combe, that village with an apparently
    inexhaustible supply of young hashers - long may they keep coming,
    and Popeye(?) - PK's friend. Deadly was away so we enjoyed a
    delayed start, a doubtful privilege as someone had left the door
    open. A hectic helter-skelter followed over some excellent cross-country
    running surface to Henlake Down, through the woods to come out
    just above the railway viaduct (and the first check - and the
    only one on the short run!).<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Some early shiggy could easily be avoided so
    Not Norman paddled enthusiastically in it, using the theory that
    if its available get it whilst one can, a method adopted by the
    older members. We went left under the railway viaduct and through
    the woods to the long/short split at the weir. The Milton Combe
    Doberman didn't want to go on the long (having more sense than
    some), but Mimi expertly manhandled him up the far bank. IAT?
    took the long forgetting that whilst he may be fit enough for
    the distance the chances of going astray are greatly increased.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">We on the 'short' were escorted by Hugh who wished
    to get back quickly for another cigarette - knowing that hashing
    can seriously damage your health. There were but seven of us
    - there should have been nine (at least) but thirteen year old
    new Hasher Matthew had apparently been unceremoniously shoved
    on the 'long'. We were told by his mate that he'd never run further
    than a mile in his life. We had a good laugh about that. <BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Our little group suffered from an
    embarrassment of riches; not only did we have hashers who hadn't
    ever run before, we were also being honoured by the presence
    of the Hash Horn - who was for the first time running with a
    horn! Up to now he had been a Closet Hash Horn - producing a
    magnificent gleaming instrument from the boot of his car - a
    quick tootle - and back in the boot. But now the weight problem
    had been solved (of the Horn, not the carrier). And so he was
    now brandishing a French Truffle Horn - a Horn par excellence!
    It is of course the Closed Season for truffles, but no doubt
    he will be more successful later. Mind you with Viv's running
    performance the Horn is more likely to tell us where we have
    been than where we are going.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The trail took us along the path beside the river
    in an unhash-like manner but it is a beautiful area and well
    worth a return visit. Eventually we climbed back out of the valley
    and had but a short jog back to the cars. Despite my injury (see
    pages 3, 4 and 5), I went for an extra run and realised after
    a while that the trees I was heading for were Hanger Down Clump,
    and we were, of course, on Hanger Down. A cry came across on
    the wind from the other side of the valley, an ON ON or a cry
    of despair. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">&quot;And what was
    happening on the 'long' run?&quot;, I hear you say. Well, I'm
    glad you asked me that (how clever of you to think of it). Not
    Nornan reported that the 'long' went down into Ivybridge through
    a housing estate and back to the bridge over the railway line
    at Cole Lane, with the last check being reported here. If the
    pack had been together at this point, the climb up the road and
    then up the footpath to the moor would have put paid to any sense
    of togetherness. The trail then proceeded northwards around the
    edge of the moor a la Plympton 333rd run. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">Having got to Tor Rock Quarry, the depleted pack
    of three decided enough was enough. Upon finding a path with
    a sign that said 'Private - No Entry', they followed it down
    to the road and returned to Ivybridge where they retraced the
    start of the run. The run proper, I believe, continued on to
    Harford Moor Gate, down to Harford, right along the road towards
    Torr and back on to Hanger Down by Hall Farm or Hall Cross. Wherever
    it went, it had the effect of spreading Hashers over a large
    part of the countryside.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">One particular group contained IAT?, Matthew
    (who'd never run further than a mile before) and Ray from St.
    Albans (who'd never been anywhere near the area before). Realising
    that being led by IAT? had, not to put too fine a point on it,
    its negative side, St. Albans took off on his own and returned
    without further difficulty to Judy, who was maintaining a lonely
    vigil at the cars - such loyalty goes strangely with normal hash
    behaviour. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Arriving at the junction
    by Harford Church IAT? decided that the Cornwood direction offered
    greater scope as he knew the direction from Cornwood to Plympton.
    Matthew was beginning to realise that his Monday evenings could
    be better spent learning Mongolian than being led around in the
    dark by some middle aged idiot who had no idea where he'd been,
    where he was, or where he was going. But stay - getting to Hall
    Cross (start of a Not Norman run some time ago) he turned left
    and made his way out on to Hanger Down. Nearly getting to the
    Clump (and less than half a mile from the cars) he turned back
    to the road, (because as the Actress said to the Bishop, &quot;Approaching
    from this direction you don't know what you're getting into&quot;),
    and continued on towards Cornwood.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Of course we 'short' runners were not concerned
    about these matters. Whilst invective was being raised, the Hares'
    parentage discussed with some frankness and general despair settling
    on the various groups, we were settling down to our drinks at
    the Exchange. A strange pub normally frequented solely by the
    youth of the town and hung about with peculiar farming implements.
    Can one be at ease standing under a plough? How conscientiously
    was it hung up there? I doubt very much if the sounds of Beethoven's
    Ninth had ever graced this establishment. And there was no food.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Endosperm arrived sometime later still in running
    gear and muddy shoes muttering<BR>
    something about &quot;In Norman's car&quot;. I wouldn't normally
    want to go into a pub that would allow people like that in, he
    was happy though - his money was &quot;In Norman's car&quot;
    so he got as many free drinks down him as he could. Viv also
    had something going about &quot;In Norman's car&quot;, but I
    was not quite clear what. It was sufficient, anyway, for Norman
    to start giving Viv an extremely hard time when he eventually
    returned to the pub, because he seemed to have been under the
    impression that Viv was out on the moor somewhere blowing his
    horn. If he'd asked us we could have told him he was in the pub!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Search parties were being mounted to look for
    those in peril on the moor (including Viv who was in the pub!).
    As the Farting Ferret said, this run was the only time he's been
    able to have a pee without a crowd of females lighting upon him.
    Not Norman had the solution to finding the missing throng, though,
    by working out the most impossible place they would be (years
    of delivering furniture to the wrong address prepares you for
    this). And so it was that he found them on the road approaching
    Cornwood. IAT? gave some explanation which to him seemed logical,
    but I understand Norman didn't agree.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Back in the pub we had settled down in a corner
    on the three piece suite (did you ever hear of a pub with a three
    piece suite in it?) the better to relax and savour the misfortunes
    of those souls stranded out there in the cold wind. Hash Cash's
    sole concern was that some of them hadn't paid. Late arrivals
    were greeted with an outstretched hand for money rather than
    warmth and bonhomie. One way and another all returned: Endosperm
    was able to change out of his damp shoes and socks and shorts
    (l got a drink out of him as soon as possible), Viv got his bollocking,
    the Hares protested valiantly, Matthew wondered how anybody could
    have thought hashing was enjoyable and IAT? took his criticism
    in the manner to which he has become accustomed. If we can create
    this chaos after over two hundred runs, it warms the heart to
    think of what we will be able to achieve with our first car rally.
    It should be the sort of thing where the police of five counties
    are alerted.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">IAT? is running in the London Marathon and I
    have discovered that Ladbrokes are running a book on him, the
    odds at the moment are:-<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">300-1 that he can find London<BR>
    1,000-1 that he can find the start<BR>
    2-1 that he can find the start but on the wrong day<BR>
    Evens that he starts with the Elite ladies<BR>
    3-2 that he goes astray on the first bend<BR>
    2-1 that he'll try shortcutting<BR>
    1-2 on that he'll get lost shortcutting<BR>
    1-3 on that he'll tell someone he knows this area like the back
    of his hand<BR>
    No odds would be quoted either that a search party would have
    to be sent out or that he would finish.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">He is running for Diabetics in Tavistock and
    is seeking sponsorship - please give generously.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">An idea that the Committee might
    like to discuss:<BR>
    a) that someone makes some signs<BR>
    b) that Hares put these signs at strategic places to indicate
    where the start might be<BR CLEAR="ALL">c) this would be particularly
    useful to new members who do not know the area as well as long
    standing members do<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">A radical
    idea maybe - but one worth discussing!</FONT></P>
