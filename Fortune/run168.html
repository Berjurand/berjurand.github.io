    to the subscription money collected, there were about fifteen
    runners skulking around the back of the Ocean Bistro for the
    start of this superb run. Despite having a green flashing light
    to herald the 'accidental' starting point (or perhaps because
    of it), the hounds eventually all arrived five minutes late for
    the off - all except Bloodnock and Sara, who were later still.
    Well no-one told the hares about the need for a short run before
    a meal but the hounds remained in an optimistic mood (= blissful
    ignorance).</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Everyone was off to a quick start along
    the Richmond Walk towards Mutton Cove only to loop back past
    Prospect Row and the Mount Wise Squash Centre. The latecomers
    joined the run at Devonport Hill only to find that a hot pace
    left them in the all too familiar position that they had started
    in. The whole hash left the sports ground and crossed into the
    Paradise Road graveyard where the obvious check-back was lost
    under a tombstone, however, our lights were a pretty sight. <BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">There was a brief opportunity to
    dry the trainers before squelching across Stoke Damerel rugby
    field. The keenies were again lost in a thicket above the Milehouse
    substation all following an obvious false trail in Kamakasi style.
    The sentry-guard at the bus depot waved us out of his land with
    a bemused smite of disbelief and was quite disappointed when
    we ail survived crossing Alma Road.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A sinuous
    route through Central park finally lead us past the cemetary
    and out past the Post Office sorting station. Deadly could not
    resist climbing the steps at Victoria Park to show off to the
    others, who, in turn, quickly sped past him in full cry for the
    bucket.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1"
     FACE="Arial">Apart from the welcome return of Living Dangerously
    and Tarmac, there were two new runners: Paul B. who said he would
    never come again (wise man) and Karen accompanied by Skiddy (David
    S). There were a few fair weather strangers in the Ocean Bistro
    who were noticeably absent from the run (I.A.T., I'm Not Norman,
    Horse Trough, etc.) Dick Turpin was predictably missing - perhaps
    he has &quot;died of ignorance&quot;. El Pee was dining and wining
    a mysterious lady friend.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The fare was excellent
    and well presented suiting everyone but Bloodnock, who complained
    of &quot;no chips&quot;. Snakehips tried to steal the glory by
    acting &quot;Le garcon&quot;. Drake's ruling Military Junta was
    roused into action by the bridal march and undemocratically announced
    the new committee during a pregnant pause - well, it couldn't
    be worse could it? Grand Master: Chris M (aka Deerhunter), Hash
    Cash: Diane G, Hare Mistress: Jane P (aka George), Head Scribe:
    John A (aka Farting Armpit), Hon. Sec: Mike S (aka Snakehips),
    Hash Horn: Richard T .<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Imogen,
    George's mum, described how her husband had destroyed the new
    Post Office red Passat - he obviously forgot it wasn't the P.O.van,
    and no anguish was spared for his fate.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR

    1. Please check that you are credited with all your runs and
    'hared-runs'.<BR>
    2. Runners should pay before the run the ghastly sum of 50p.<BR>
    3. Nasty names needed for some unadulterated hashers.<BR>
    4. Suggestions for future whingeing walks please.</FONT></P>
