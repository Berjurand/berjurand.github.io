     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I was running on the
    moor late one night<BR>
    When my eyes beheld an eerie sight<BR>
    Monsters from a bog began to rise<BR>
    Then suddenly to my surprise.....<BR>
    They did the hash (they did the monster hash)<BR>
    The monster hash (it was a graveyard smash)<BR>
    With torches on in a flash, (they did the monster hash)<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">That was Drake's Halloween hash from the Whiteworks
    Road, near Princetown. Absolutely Mega-Spook-Tastic, Mate!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Limpalong's fiendish driving had had a weird
    effect on his passengers; Endosperm had a devil of a time, changing
    into a demon during the course of the journey (Knock Knock! Who's
    there? Demon. Demon who? Demon who's knocking on this door!),
    and HT2, looking like death warmed up, had become Frankenhalfpint
    (a stein being too big a container for this monster).<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">A sprinkling of magic dust led the hashers over
    the hillside under hare Begorrah's spell. Uncannily, Grabarse's
    light died within the first couple of minutes of the start. He
    didn't stop after the funeral because he says, from extensive
    experience, that it's better to do it in the dark than not do
    it at all.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Anyone casting an evil eye over the hash could
    see that Tinkerbell was in shorts, as befits her stature, Deadly
    was in tights, Not Norman was in a bin-liner (very appropriate),
    and Renault was in a leat - right up to her neck. Renault thought
    that she was going to die but found she couldn't escape that
    easily. Cream Sod had crept out of the crypt for the evening
    to catch up on a backlog of short-cutting, and to promote his
    new book &quot;Up the Munros in Wellies&quot;. Future titles
    in the series will include &quot;The Matterhorn in Winklepickers&quot;
    and &quot;Everest in Flip Flops&quot;. Special offer; order now
    and get one for the price of two.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">At Halloween grisly shape-shifters stalk the
    moor; Endo looked behind him and saw Tinkerbell having a tinkle..................<BR
    CLEAR="ALL">on her bell. When he looked again she was gone and
    all he could see was a black dog but the bell continued ringing!
    He's now convinced that Tinkerbell is really a were-dog (as in
    &quot;Bewere of the Dog&quot;). Endo was going to tell Sub but
    then decided it might be better to let sleeping dogs lie.<BR>
    </FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" FACE="Arial"><BR CLEAR="ALL"></FONT><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The tale that Mudflaps
    told was a real horror story; apparently Jelly-Belly had carried
    her across the leat! Cream Sod quoted the Hash Rule stating that
    where there is water to be crossed a female hasher may be carried
    - but no further than halfway. Anonymouse confirmed this version
    of events, as he had been watching from a safe distance and,
    as he said, it makes a change for someone else to have Mudflaps
    on their back.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Where the trail actually went was anyone's guess
    but it certainly had the bewitched, bothered and bewildered hashers
    staggering around in magic circles. It was not long before Monks
    impotent/Nuns cross Farm was passed and soon after the cars loomed
    out of the gloom (without any drivers at the wheel). All in all
    it was a frighteningly good trail from Begorrah and Yakki.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The Plume of Feathers was host to the most ghastly
    collection of fiends ever seen outside of the House of Commons.
    The evening got off to a promising start because rumour had it
    that instead of the usual tongue-lashing our GM (Gruesome Monster)
    would be giving everyone a punch. It felt good to be let off
    so lightly, but spirits soared when it was realised the GM was
    in fact dispensing drinks.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">A survey of the creatures on display showed very
    different ideas about what is scary: Rover turned up wearing
    a giant napkin with tomato sauce on it - extremely frightening
    to anyone who has seen Rover eating. Anonymouse was dressed as
    Lawrence of Arabia - very scary for camels. FFerret with his
    top hat was the spitting image of Noddy Holder from the 70's
    rock group Slade - petrifying to anyone who can remember long
    side-burns, platform shoes and flairs. Yakkidah looked like Michael
    Jackson - certain to give small boys nightmares. Gnasher appeared
    in a lady's wig and his wife's tights - strange but not frightening
    unless, of course, he's YOUR dentist. However, he produced two
    pulsing light globes and put them down his tights. When his balls
    started flashing, it was obvious he had come as a Ghoulie! Heinz
    was keen to borrow Gnasher's balls as he didn't have any of his
    own. A great deal of entertainment was to be had by trying to
    decide whether IAT puts on a werewolf mask for Halloween, or
    whether a werewolf puts on an IAT mask for the rest of the year.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">At the start of the evening Snakehips was the
    Invisible Man but then he went and spoiled it all by putting
    in an appearance. He wasn't very impressed by what he saw in
    the bar and reckoned that if everyone wanted to look like ghosts
    all they had to do was hire a minibus and get Deadly to do the
    driving. In fact, Mussels was going to come as a ghost by wearing
    net curtains, but then decided against it as the window was too
    heavy to carry. Not Norman's costume consisted of a huge witch's
    hat. It was so large that we only knew he was under it because
    someone recognised his trainers sticking out from under the brim.<BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">As Skippy posed for a photographic
    exposure Dastardly Deadly and Fiendish FFerret (Zombie &amp;
    Son) took it literally and pulled up her shirt, trying to turn
    it into a pornographic exposure. Watch out for her photo on page
    3 .................of the Damart winter catalogue. Oh dear, Oh
    dear, Deadly had some ghastly fake blood poured on him, and when
    he tried to scrub it off it left him with a hole in his head
    (luckily it was nowhere near his brain). The other side effect
    was that his hair went a bright shade of pink, but not as pink
    as his face when his wife asked him whose lipstick it was on
    his ear. Skippy beware! Should he be known as 'Redley' from now
    on, or 'Pinky and not so Perky'? Will the Barbara Cartland look
    really suit him?<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Traditionally
    horrible Halloween games were played at the instigation of our
    Gruesome Monster, Yakkidah:<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">The
    murdering of Father Abraham (yes, that stupid song again) - led
    by Endosperm and HT2.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Catch the cushion under
    a sheet - which Medlock found out to her cost means &quot;give
    us a grope&quot; to Thirsty Glass, because he said a boob and
    a cushion feel the same in the dark.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The
    rubber glove over the head trick (don't try this at home children).
    Won by Rambo whose head fits perfectly well into a rubber glove.
    Unfortunately, he's never learnt to get a glove over his hand
    and so he has to stand on his head in the sink to do the washing
    up.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The softest bum competition - musical
    bums, six to a chair. Looked like a smaller than usual Drake
    mismanagement committee meeting.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Apple bobbing - a much
    more interesting version than usual, played as shoe bobbing,
    courtesy of FFerret.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT

    to bowl everyone over. Bad dog, Rover!</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR

    so ended Drake's Halloween Frightnight - a spooktacular success!</FONT></P>
