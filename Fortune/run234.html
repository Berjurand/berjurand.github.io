     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It was one of those warm, balmy summer
    nights.The sound of the distant bullfinch could be heard carried
    on a scented breeze from afar. The bluebells were just peaking
    in that glorious purple haze that only nature has been able to
    capture. Peace was on earth and the heavens were at rest in this
    small corner of the empire. Alas, the gentle waters of the Lee
    lapped no more on the mighty wheel of the ancient mill. Times
    were a-changing my friends, as the villagers who earlier had
    ventured out, were returning home to a simple and humble meal
    of ale and bread, hastening with the thought that tranquillty
    was about to be lost for ever more. Right you bastards, that's
    the cultural bit over, now on to the hash.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Had it not been for a very muted 'Old Queen'
    and the murmurings of the Grand Master we would have been away
    before Norman had arrived. Such a pity - it would have been nice
    to see him checking for once to catch us up. A feeling of deja
    vu prevailed as we crossed the road to a check by &quot;that
    field&quot;. On On up the lane was called, but the shortcutters
    (including Norman), made off across the field. At the top of
    the lane speedo Les was off and checking in all directions with
    Deadly in hot pursuit. Naturally, both got it wrong as grey cells
    Endosperm led the way past a field and over an electric (ouch)
    fence.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The sawdust led us on to a check and a brief
    re-group. Deadly and Speedo were doing their headless chicken
    duo whilst the rest were led by silky Snakehips back the way
    we came and off left up hill and down to yet another check. Here
    we were joined by the Milton Combies who lost their way and didn't
    know where to find us. After a little shuffling the headless
    duo had it checked out and we all started busting a gut upwards.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Hubtrims, sporting a rather provocative pair
    of shorts, and Gordon were spirited way to re-join us some twenty
    minutes later. Through a fielde we went and On On to yet another
    check at a T junction.Yesman attempted to stay with Snakehips
    who just changed a gear, which left Yesman to trot along with
    me at my more even pace. Rover<BR>
    has developed a whole new running style following his visit to
    the CASBAR. Watch him next week- the motion is so smooth - YUK!
    What a pity it affects the speed so much.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">We arrived at a check on the southern side of the
    A38 road, but who could have kicked it out sending Deadly off
    on his own? Next came the &quot;Boring Road Run&quot; - yawn
    - but it soon brought us to 'The Climax'. Sorry F.Ferret you
    missed out again. To cries of &quot;It's cold around my watsits!&quot;,
    we were herded up the middle of the river to home. I found the
    water so relieving, especially as I had the squitters and, yes,
    I was in front!!! (use your imagination). <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">It was On On into the skittle alley, where side bets
    were being placed. Secret practising had been going on and Bunny
    looked Invincible. Slumper or Splasher forced raffle tickets
    upon us and Maureen did her bit with the folding. Shame about
    the prizes NORMAN! What a SCUM production! Don't ask me who won
    the skittles as I haven't got the faintest idea. Any sport which
    requires me to place more than one foot in front of the other
    is just too technical for my grey cells. Dogcatcher turned up
    at the On Down. What a nice fellow - he left me to guard his
    chips whilst he played with his balls!</FONT></P>
