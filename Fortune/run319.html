    The day had started badly, when having enquired of HT2 &amp;
    Endosperm as to the time of the Burrator Boxing Day Fun Run,
    I arrived just before noon to find that the run had started at
    10.30am, and consequently there was not a straggler in sight.
    After waiting around to see if my misinformants would turn up
    so I could give them a good kick up their matching shorts (I
    must say that some people have long memories - who would have
    thought HT2 would have waited so long to get her own back for
    that incident at the Battle of Wounded Knee?), I eventually ran
    around the reservoir with my son Malcolm, who, to add insult
    to injury, beat me. To look on the bright side, however, at least
    I got the right day, unlike when I tried to take part in the
    Venford orienteering event!</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The day did not improve,
    as my horse was beaten in the King George VI steeplechase and
    my other son beat me at chess. So it was that with much trepidation
    I set off for New Waste Gate, fully expecting that the hash had
    been transferred to Harford Moor, or had been run the night before,
    or had been cancelled due to the hare staying in the Royal Oak
    too long. But no, on arriving at 7.25pm, I found the Farting
    Ferret already there and awaiting the arrival of hordes of hashers.
    Ten minutes later our numbers had been swelled with the arrival
    of Rover (the hare), Snakehips and Not Norman.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Snakehips,
    for once not being able to use injury as an excuse for not hashing,
    and realising that drastic measures were required to avoid having
    to do the trail, proceeded to lock his car keys in his car. Thus
    our numbers were reduced to three hounds and a hare (and a partridge
    in a pear tree?). Attempts were made to persuade him to run,
    but he said he needed to think about how to get his keys out
    of the car, and he couldn't run and think at the same time. I
    have come across this aberration before in Mimi who admits he
    is unable or unwilling to use his brain when laying a trail (which
    if you've ever laid a trail with him is pretty obvious). Mimi
    offered to be a 'packhorse' for my run tonight because he owes
    me a favour - one hesitates to contemplate what he would do if
    he bore me a grudge!</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Having spent a fruitless
    quarter of an hour trying to break into Snakehips car, the skeleton
    hash finally set off in the direction of the reservoir, from
    where it was a climb up to the stone row at Stalldown Barrow.
    From time to time the others had to wait for your scribe to catch
    up, as due to my earlier exertions around Burrator, a faltering
    torch and general lack of condition, I was being left somewhere
    in the rear. This was particularly galling to the Ferret, who
    was heard to mention more than once that it would have been better
    if I had locked my keys in my car!</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We reached
    Dendles Wood where the hare attempted to direct me home, but
    not having Deadly's persuasiveness, he failed. Half an hour later,
    after making agonisingly slow progress through the woods and
    across the river Yealm, I emerged from the woods a few hundred
    yards from the point of entry, at the same time wishing I had
    taken the hare's advice.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Back at the cars after
    one and three quarter hours thought, Snakehips had decided to
    smash his car's window, whereupon Not Norman offered to do the
    dirty deed so that Snakehips could lay the blame on vandals.
    Years of coshing old ladies on the head and snatching their handbags
    had prepared Norman for this.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">At the Mountain Inn,
    the landlord said that he had been confident that we would not
    let him down, which shows how gullible some people are. F Ferret
    bought a round of drinks for the whole hash, which cost him &pound;2.50.
    He then announced that he was off skiing for three weeks, which
    means he has missed out on tonight's run, which I am confident
    you will agree has been the best run of the year!</FONT></P>
