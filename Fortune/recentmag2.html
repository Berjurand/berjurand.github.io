    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It was
    an excellent venue, starting from the pub car park in Wotter.
    As we were about to cross the road, Dishy was heard to say jokingly,
    &quot;Look out for Plodder&quot;, and right on cue, he came screeching
    along the road. He's getting better, almost on time. Keep practicing.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Within 20 metres
    we were on the moor looking for the first check. Limpalong, the
    joint (disjointed?) hare, lost his way immediately and fell head
    first into a gorse bush. IAT was very chipper as he had a new
    lighting system, only for it to fail within the first five minutes.
    He was in the dark again. What's new? Not Norman turned up after
    a long absence and stuck to IAT? Like glue. Hasn't he learned
    by now? In training for the Great North Run, Rover also managed
    to go arse over apex, only he chose some dung for his landing
    pat. (Gerrit???)<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">We were all kept together very well by Euthanasia
    who loitered with obvious intent trying to remember where she
    had instructed her co-hares to lay the sawdust. She declared
    that it all looks different at night! (Has her boyfriend told
    her something?) This was an unusually dry run, so Mudflaps didn't
    flap and Squelcher did not Squelch and fortunately Chippendale
    did not do what he was named for!!! (Except in the car park!)
    Boringly, as usual. Whimpers, Squawk, Plodder, Anonymouse and
    Rover were up front, now joined by Squelcher.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">In the pub, the Beast was playing redcoat, arranging
    his annual trip to Butlins, whilst Plodder was arranging Christmas
    early and Rover was fleecing us all in a good cause. The Moorland
    Inn is fully reinstated as a Drake H3 pub, despite the Landlord's
    horror at IAT's insistence on eating with his fingers.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">A good run. A good turn out.</FONT></P>
