    Take your turn at being a hare. If you are new to laying a trail

    Find a suitable area which you already familiar with or get to
    know somewhere new. A 1:25,000 Ordnance Survey map or orienteering
    map can be used to help you plan your run. Don&#146;t choose
    a route that is so restricted that it is clear where it is going
    to go. A good hash keeps the hounds guessing! Make the start
    location the best place for the run, which in most cases is unlikely
    to be the pub.</FONT></P>

    Find a suitable pub near to your run as the on down. If you have
    not been there before pay it a visit to see what it is like.
    Check with the landlord or landlady that it is okay for the hash
    to come there and tell them the date of the run, the time the
    hash will be arriving, the approximate number of hashers who
    will be turning up and make sure that bar food is available.
    Find out whether dogs are allowed in. A good hash pub has Real
    Ale, reasonably priced wholesome food and a welcoming atmosphere.

    go around to everyone and ask them if they know of anything that
    happened on the run or after it that you can write about. Mention

    Check out the route of the run before laying the trail by walking
    or running it at least once (preferably twice or more). Make
    sure most of it is suitable for running. Difficult terrain such
    as through boulder fields, wooded thickets or bogs can be used
    to slow the pack, but should only be used for relatively short
    distances. The hounds want to be able to run most of the hash,
    and so will not thank a hare who lays a run where the footing
    is excessively difficult or which includes large amounts of gorse,
    brambles, stinging nettles or bracken. </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"

    Make full use of swampy areas, streams, rivers, mud etc. to add

    you are responsible for the safety of the runners on your hash
    and so you should make sure that any obstacles can be crossed
    without danger. Rivers rise very quickly on Dartmoor and so it
    is better not to use river crossings if heavy rain is forecast.
    If you do have any river crossings, try to have a contingency
    plan available for an alternative route if on the night of the

     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">What To Use To Lay A Trail</FONT><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    Trails can be laid in sawdust, wood shavings, flour, chalk or
    lime. Sawdust or wood<BR>
    shavings are probably the best, because as natural products they
    are environmentally friendly, cannot be eaten by animals, and
    withstand the rain quite well. If they have a softwood origin
    they show up much better than if they come from a hardwood source.
    Flour has the advantage that only a relatively small amount is
    needed for a trail because it shows up very well, but the disadvantages
    are that it is easily washed away by the rain and can be eaten
    by animals. Powdered chalk is quite good for laying trails but
    can be difficult to obtain. Some hashes lay their runs in lime,
    but this is to be avoided if at all possible, because it can
    burn the skin and eyes, and damages the countryside. </FONT><FONT

     FACE="Arial"><BR>
    It is desirable to have more than one hare, although not absolutely
    necessary if the<BR>
    trail is well laid. The advantage of having two hares (or more)
    is that when laying the trail there is someone to help carry
    the sawdust and to assist with setting loops, check backs etc.
    Another benefit is that on the night of the hash one person can
    accompany the front runners to ensure that they take the correct
    route and do not shortcut, whilst someone else is available to
    help those at the middle / back of the pack to find the trail
    or to suggest shortcuts. </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A

     FACE="Arial">When To Lay The Trail</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    Most trails are normally laid on the Sunday before the run, although
    there are some<BR>
    people able to do it on the Monday of the hash. Any earlier than
    Sunday means that the sawdust is vulnerable for longer to the
    weather and to vandalism. If you are laying your hash in summer
    in an area which is heavily used by the public, you may find
    that it is less likely to be damaged if you lay the trail later
    in the day after people have gone home.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Some of Drake&#146;s
    runs are &#145;live hare&#146; runs, where the hare sets off
    approximately half an hour to an hour before the hounds. These
    hashes are normally laid in flour because it shows up well and
    enough for a whole trail can be carried by one person. To be
    successful this type of run requires an experienced hare who
    is also a fast runner in order to minimise the possibility of
    them being caught by the hounds and so ending the hash early.

     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">How Long It Takes To Lay A Trail</FONT><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    Laying a trail should normally take two or more hares about two
    to two and a half hours to complete (providing you do not have
    to return to your car to collect sawdust). Twelve to fifteen
    supermarket carrier bags of sawdust should be enough for one
    trail. Stuff as many bags as possible into a rucksack and carry
    what else you can manage. </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A

     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    If your hash is going to be run in the dark, ensure that the
    individual drops of sawdust are about ten paces apart. Leaving
    longer gaps can result in the hounds not being able to follow
    the trail. Wind, rain and fallen leaves can all obscure or obliterate
    the sawdust, and so long gaps between drops only makes matters
    worse. In foggy conditions the hounds need to be able to see
    the next drop of sawdust if they are not to get lost. It is much
    better to trick people with check backs, back checks and loops
    when they are on the trail, rather than for them not to be able
    to find it at all! </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A HREF="Resources/whatyou.html#index">[^

    When laying a hash, look out for landmarks or memorable features
    in the countryside that you can use to help you to find the trail
    again during the run. This is invaluable if the hounds need your
    help to locate it (particularly in the dark). <BR CLEAR="ALL"></FONT><FONT

    When laying your run, make sure that the hounds cannot pick up
    the end of the trail at the start and then run it the wrong way.
    Try to ensure that the different parts of the trail are not too
    close together, otherwise the hounds may discover the wrong section
    and end up following it. If you see this starting to happen during
    the hash call those involved back. Unfortunately, this is easier
    said than done. </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A HREF="Resources/whatyou.html#index">[^

     FACE="Arial"><BR>
    Don&#146;t try to be too ambitious with your trail by attempting
    to cover a lot of ground, or by laying runs which are &#145;out
    and back&#146;. Definitely avoid road runs. Trails which attempt
    to cover a large area are more likely to go wrong. In addition,
    any delays in the hounds finding the sawdust mean that the run
    can easily go over the hour. Out and back runs, where the trail
    heads straight out then is reversed half way through, are not
    to be recommended as anyone getting injured near the half way
    point will have a very long walk back to the cars (for which
    you will not be thanked). Such runs also tend to be rather boring.
    Never, ever, lay a road run - Drake H3 does not run on the roads.
    Relatively short stretches of road can be used, for connecting
    up footpaths or at the start or end of a run, but any more than
    this will not be appreciated! </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A

    <P><A NAME="check points"></A><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1"
     FACE="Arial">Check Points</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1"
     FACE="Arial"><BR>
    Your hash should include frequent check points (indicated by
    a circle) where the hounds have to look for the correct trail
    amongst several possibilities. False trails should be laid for
    a distance of anything up to two hundred metres away from the
    check. Indicate that a trail is false by laying a cross at the
    end of it. Once the hounds<BR>
    have discovered the correct route from a check, make sure that
    the check circle is<BR>
    kicked through in that direction. This will enable any backmarkers
    who arrive at the<BR>
    check to immediately see where the trail goes and so help them
    to catch up with the rest of the hash. </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"
     FACE="Arial"><A HREF="Resources/whatyou.html#index">[^ index]</A></FONT></P>

    <P><A NAME="check points with no false trails"></A><FONT COLOR="#ffffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Check Points With No False Trails</FONT><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    Occasionally check points can be laid with only the correct trail
    marked. The hounds<BR>
    will expect there to be false trails and will spread out in all
    directions to look for them. It therefore means that in order
    to slow the pack, the trail must not be too easy to discover.
    Consequently, this type of check works best on a daylight hash
    or when the correct trail is laid on a clear footpaths or tracks.
    Making the trail hard to find in the dark can mean that it can&#146;t
    be found at all! </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A HREF="Resources/whatyou.html#index">[^

    <P><A NAME="loops"></A><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Loops</FONT><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    Include plenty of loops in the trail so that the faster runners
    have to double back.When the slower runners see them coming back
    again they will be able to shortcut and join up with them. Don&#146;t
    lay trails which go in a straight line for any distance because
    the slower runners will be left behind and it will be very difficult
    for them to catch up.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Loops are particularly
    useful on hills because the front runners can be tricked into
    running up the slope, only to have to come back down again relatively
    close to where they started. The slower runners will be able
    to see or hear the front runners returning and so be able to
    shortcut, thus avoiding having to climb the hill themselves.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If you use the
    above tactics when laying your trail there is a good chance that
    you will keep the hash together. However, be careful that the
    out and back parts of the loop are not too close together, otherwise
    the front runners will see the trail returning and shortcut.
    On the other hand, the out and back of the loop must not be too
    far apart, otherwise the slower runners will not be able to shortcut.

    A good way of slowing down the front runners is to lay the sawdust
    in such a way as to make them over-run the correct trail and
    then let them know they have done so by laying a back check.
    When they see the back check symbol (a cross in a circle) it
    means that they must retrace their steps and look for the correct
    trail somewhere off to the left or right of the trail they are
    on. The change of direction can have occurred anywhere between
    the previous check point and the back check itself. As the front
    runners have to run back the way they came to try to find the
    trail, it means they should meet up with the slower runners who
    were previously behind them. </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A

     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    Long / short splits can be used to give a longer or harder run
    to those who want it,<BR>
    whilst those with more sense can take a less demanding route.
    The direction of each type of trail is indicated by arrows with
    an &#145;L&#146; and &#145;S&#146; against them. Sawdust should
    be laid for each route and they should both join up later on.
    In order that the hash does not spend too much time apart, it
    is probably best not to have more than two long / short splits
    per trail. </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A HREF="Resources/whatyou.html#index">[^

    Lay an arrow to indicate the direction of the trail if there
    is any likelihood of confusion occurring e.g. when long and short
    trails rejoin, to indicate the safest point for a river crossing
    etc. Near to the end of the trail lay an &#145;On Home&#146;
    arrow to let the hounds know the end is nigh. </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"

    On the evening of your hash it is useful if you to get to the
    start early so that you can deal with any problems that crop
    up (like finding hashers who have gone to the wrong car park
    etc.). Before setting off, count the number of runners and if
    there are any new runners, find out their names and which cars
    they came in, so that you can check that they have returned safely
    after the hash has finished.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">During the run
    you should try to ensure that the hounds can find the trail.
    However, please give them adequate time to find it for themselves
    before pointing out to them where it is.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If you see someone
    disappearing off into the distance in entirely the wrong direction
    and it is clear that they won&#146;t be returning unless they
    are called back, either go after them yourself or arrange someone
    else to run after them (after telling the rescuer where the trail
    goes).</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Advise those
    that need them of any short cuts and try to make sure that the
    front runners do not shortcut loops. Make sure that all the checks
    are kicked through in the right direction. Call &#145;On On&#146;
    when the correct trail is discovered so that everyone knows where
    it is. </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A HREF="Resources/whatyou.html#index">[^

    If it looks as if your trail is in danger of lasting well over
    the hour do not be afraid to<BR>
    shorten it by showing the hounds short cuts they can take or
    even by telling them the quickest way back to the cars. However,
    use your judgement, people are less likely to want to cut short
    a run on a warm summer&#146;s evening than they might during
    a torrential downpour in February. If you are not keen on verbal
    abuse, for your own sake, try not to lay runs lasting over an
    hour just after Christmas or in early January when people are
    likely to be at their least fit. </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A

    Once the run is over, it is the hare&#146;s job to check that
    everyone who set off on the hash has returned safely. If someone
    is missing, wait for about ten minutes then organise search parties.
    Ideally, each search party should have a mobile phone to keep
    in contact with each other as well as with someone acting as
    &#145;control&#146; back at the car park. In this way everyone
    will know when the missing person has returned or has been found.

    At the on down after the run, enjoy the congratulations of your
    fellow hashers for a job well done (or not as the case may be),
    then relieve them of their money, because, as hare, you are responsible
    for the collection of the hash subscriptions. Tick the paid runners
    off on the hash list then give the list and money to the Hash
    Cash. </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A HREF="Resources/whatyou.html#index">[^

    Don&#146;t worry, no trail ever goes entirely to plan. As long
    as you have tried your best and everyone returns safe and sound
    after having a run in the countryside then that is all that really
    matters (you will know how successful your run was from the amount
    of abuse you get from the hounds - the more abuse, the better
    the run). If your run didn&#146;t work out as you would have
    liked, think of how it could have been improved then include
    the improvements in your next run. No one gets to be a good at
    it straight away - practice really does make for the perfect
    lay! </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A HREF="Resources/whatyou.html#index">[^
