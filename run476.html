    goodly crowd gathered at Welcome Valley, Hexworthy on this crisp
    Monday evening. Quite clearly the most common Christmas present
    received by hashers was a seasonal virus, as conversation dwelt
    on a few key words; ache, mucous, pain, runs, tightness in the
    chest. (Why do male hashers buy their women new bras every Xmas?).<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">A few words from the Hare indicated that there
    were problems with the run, problems with the pub and some of
    us were likely to drown this night. The problem with the run
    was soon apparent; some rotten sod had laid tarmac over Zippy's
    trail. There we were surrounded by moorland, but wherever the
    trail went there was tarmac. Cries of &quot;Boring Road Run&quot;
    were heard from some hashers who had failed to appreciate the
    extent to which this most illustrious of Hares trail had been
    sabotaged.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Eventually the trail managed to find
    some vacant grass before two crossings of a stream to whet our
    appetites. Only IAT in his black Captain Condom outfit failed
    to get soaked. On down to the banks of the West Dart and then
    on up for the quickies and along the bank for the slowies and
    true Christmas revellers. Slo Jo revealed her hippy tendencies
    as she declared &quot;I'm a tree!&quot;, and fair enough she
    was firmly planted in a bog. After some discussion it was decided
    not to let this aspect of her character blossom and so with some
    difficulty she was uprooted and helped to the river crossing.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">It was at the river that a Good Samaritan was
    needed, and so Handlebars did his John the Baptist impression
    by standing in the raging torrent and offering to baptise any
    volunteers. Most hashers were soaked to waist level. Dishy is
    to be complimented for getting wet past the Jesus line and not
    saying it. However, HT2, who should by rights have drowned, found
    a method of crossing which caused seven hashers on the far bank
    to hold up cards with five 5.8s, one 5.9 and one 6.0. Only Bryn
    was totally submerged three times by Handlebars, but since he's
    a border collie not a sea dog, he needed saving!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Across the river there was some confused running
    through brambles until we came to a wall. The wall was ordinary,
    but there was a little Pixie (probably strayed from Dartmeet)
    sitting on it. &quot;This is my wall&quot; said the Pixie, &quot;Piss
    off&quot;. So we did, apart from Yokelbonker, who doesn't believe
    in Pixies and hopped over the wall. Fortunately he does believe
    in Trolls and hopped back over the wall to rejoin the rerouted
    hash. At Huccaby Bridge we came to a 25% hill; so designated
    because only 25% of the hashers could run up it. It was exactly
    8.00pm. What suberb timing!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">After a quick chorus of &quot;Will you. Won't
    you. Will you join the dance?&quot; which sounded like &quot;Will
    we. Won't we. Will it be the Plume?&quot; discipline was imposed
    by the Grand Master and hashers began a waiting for food vigil,
    which was well worth it as it turned out, especially for those
    who like vegetables! And so the last mainline hash of 1992 ended
    quite appropriately for a Dartmoor hash - more in the Dart than
    we had been all year!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"></FONT><B><FONT

    As most of Britain attempted to drink itself comatose by midnight,
    a select band of hashers arrived at the sparkling Endo-HT2 residence
    to be greeted by a glistening<BR>
    Drake H3 logo and Mr and Mrs Bigfoot. &quot;Not time for the
    hash Yeti&quot; they said, &quot;but<BR>
    have some hot cider cup to warm your cockles and block up your
    arteries&quot;. Then<BR>
    everyone including Mary, who'd only come for the beer, bundled
    into cars to climb to Peek Moor Gate.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">As we started to run surprise, surprise; a real
    hash with sawdust and checks and<BR>
    check backs and bloody cold rivers. But what a bonus, as torch
    beams picked out<BR>
    glittering frosty sawdust, under an amazing starry sky with a
    brilliant half moon sitting on the hilltop. This tranquil scene
    was briefly shattered by Bart as he claimed the last hashing
    injury of 1992, spraining his ankle causing copious secretions
    from his giggle gland. Its good to see a contented masochist
    (&quot;I only laugh when it hurts&quot;).<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">As we climbed to Ugborough Beacon, the trail
    was momentarily forgotten, and then lost, as the hashers appreciated
    the scene. Once we reached the top it was downhill all the way,
    ably led by Mimi and Schweppes. As the main group arrived back
    at the cars Big Ben was just belting out the old year and ringing
    in the new from Mimi's landrover. A Happy Hashing New Year indeed!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Back to the cottage for more traditional celebrations.
    It was good to see Denim and Stitch once more. Hopefully Stitch
    will be back to hashing soon after his impending decoke and rebore!
    Many thanks to HT2 and Endosperm from all present for a very
    different and enjoyable New Year.</FONT></P>
