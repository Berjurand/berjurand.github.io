    sixteen runners turned up for this momentous hash which was a
    pity. Anonymouse even went to The Warren House Inn to see if
    there were more hashers there, though why anyone would have gone
    there I cannot imagine. Thus we were ten minutes late in starting
    after Deadly and Ferret who were supposedly laying the trail
    ahead of us. I say supposedly, because fifteen minutes later,
    on one of my shortcuts, I came across the two conspirators hiding
    behind a bush sawdustless. Having been caught redhanded, they
    admitted that the trail had been laid sometime before hand and
    they were just <I>pretending</I> to lay a live run. They then
    disappeared up a track and roared off in a car which even Zippy
    could not catch.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">At this stage Dumbo and I began a series of short
    cuts which kept us in front of the rest of the hash. It was on
    one of these short cuts that Dumbo announced she was hot but
    could not take off her sweatshirt as she had a body under it.
    Whose body she did not say but I was quite relieved to see Rudolf
    turn up alive and kicking.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">At the On Down Monday money for food was being
    distributed, but not by the Old Queen. He demanded his &pound;2,
    even though, as hare, he was having a free meal courtesy of the
    pub. There are no flies on Deadly which explains why the front
    of his trousers are always wet. This was not the extent of the
    evening's largesse as free T-Shirts commemmorating the run were
    distributed even to those who had not run, such as Hairy Bollocks
    and Tinkerbell. Everyone was quite pleased with the shirts even
    after Not Norman, who is not noted for his ability to spell any
    word longer than four letters (which doesn't matter as he only
    uses four letter ones, anyway), suddenly noticed a spelling error.
    Quick thinking as ever, the Grand Master explained that it was
    the American spelling which was accepted by everyone with the
    exception of an American gentleman in the corner, but after his
    hundreth beer he saw the error of his ways. If you insist on
    the English version it can be corrected for the eight hundredth
    run.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"></FONT><B><FONT

    Long time no conflab, but have been lying low since some gal
    reported me for flashing at the top of Axtown Lane. Can't get
    away with anything these days. Got hauled in the other day for
    questioning about these moorland fires someone's been setting,
    but they let me go when I explained it was the sun reflecting
    from my binoculars when I was doing a bit of birdwatching (and
    I don't mean the feathered variety. Haw! Haw!) <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">Of course, I wouldn't have to do any of this if the
    hashers hadn't reformed their evil ways. They seem rather a dull

    with Zippy wearing his underpants on his head and the hash women
    dancing around in erotic outfits. They still run over the moor
    shouting On! On! but never put it into practice. Even Deadly
    has stopped ogling Skippy, must be getting old (Deadly that is,
    not Skippy). What can you expect when the Grand Master is the
    oldest active hasher (and when I say active I mean he still moves.
    Just!).<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">What the hash needs is
    new blood (the Spice girls I hear you say) and I know just the
    answer. We approach Martin Bell's blueblooded fillies and offer
    them more than he is doing to join Tinkerbell instead. From Anti
    Sleaze to Auntie Liza! By Gad, Betters just the thought of it
    makes the old cockles rise, and that takes some doing nowadays.
    I must write to them straight away and then get a clean supply
    of clean underwear ready, what? I reckon if I get the old tropical
    suit out, polish my monocle and wax the moustache I'll be well
    away. If they want to fight sleaze I've got plenty to give 'em,
    haw, haw! Must go now, Betters, and put my makeup on for the
    aerobics class.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Yours as ever,<BR
