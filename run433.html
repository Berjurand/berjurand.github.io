    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">On
    the evening of the 22nd, at approximately 20.00 hours, I was
    sitting in the mess in my usual seat at the golf club enjoying
    a whisky and soda and thinking about having some tiffin, when
    a motley crew of other ranks came marching through the clubhouse
    wearing strange garments and muddy shoes and shouting &quot;On
    On&quot; or some other mumbo-jumbo. Some of them were women who
    actually tried to enter the rnen's latrines. By Gad! I was so
    shaken that I had to have a double! <BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Some time later these wallahs appeared in the
    bar, looking cleaner but still improperly dressed (no jackets
    or ties). I was just making a mental note to complain to the
    committee when this frightful bounder appeared dressed in pinstripe
    jacket, T-shirt, bow tie, bermuda shorts, trainers and a fez
    ( I mean to say, wearing a hat indoors is pretty bad form, what?).
    I was so shaken I had to have another double!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Eventually they went in for their meal, and things
    quietened down in the bar - but not for long. It seems it was
    a late, late, Christmas do and some wally, sorry wallah, started
    to dish out gifts - and very strange gifts they were too. One
    Memsahib received some babys' nappies and her husband (I assume
    it was her husband, but with these people one wonders), started
    pouring water over one (I assume it was water, but with these
    people you never know). Someone else actually got some rubber
    johnnies and tried to<BR>
    put one over his head. One hears of these perverts, but to see
    one in the Golf Club! I was so shaken I had to have another double!
    Things have never been the same since they put those magazines
    in the gents' toilets.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">I had returned to my vantage point in the telephone
    booth, where I had stationed myself for a better view of the
    proceedings for my report to the committee, when horror of horrors,
    a male stripper appeared from the ladies' lounge, by Gad!, and
    stood on the table dressed only in his underpants (and pretty
    brief ones they were too, not pretty, brief you understand, but
    pretty brief), and gyrated his hips in a very suggestive manner.
    At this point I had to go and have another double, and when I
    returned the fellow had his pants on his head - 'nuff said!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Things really started to hot up now and my glasses
    steamed up. A group of young gels were prancing around dressed
    in skimpy gym-slips and stockings and singing 'I'm Forever Blowing
    Bubbles' ............... well all I can say is - lucky old Bubbles!
    At this point I had to go to the toilet as I had wet myself -
    weak bIadder, don't you know. <BR>
    The worst thing about the whole sordid business was that one
    of those weirdos was actually a member of the Golf Club - what
    a blackguard. The bounder should be court-martialled and shot
    at dawn - but before he is, I must get the names of those<BR>
    two fillies on the end ----- and then I can have a real double!</FONT><BR
