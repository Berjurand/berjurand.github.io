    Hanger Down was the setting for Drake's latest moonlight rendezvous.
    It seems that finding the location of a run is getting easier
    - just look for the traffic jam.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Following complaints
    about previous dry runs, this hare obviously wanted to be thought
    of as completely wet, as he had even arranged for a watersplash
    in the first fifty yards of the run. Everyone took to this like
    ducks to water, or Drakes to a lake (maybe <I>this</I> was why
    the hash logo was changed).</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Up on Hanger Down the
    trail initially proved elusive, with hashers dispersed in all
    directions. With their light bulbs glowing above their heads
    it looked as if everyone was simultaneously having a good idea,
    but as this was Drake H3 there was no likelihood of that. It
    was the gruesome twosome, Deadly and F Ferret who discovered
    the trail. It's obvious when they're on - it's the only time
    they're quiet! When two of Drake's newer members, Chris and Nigel,
    quickly caught up, Deadly and Ferret decided to show them a clean
    pair of heels. After all, if you can't outrun them at least you
    can stop and show them that you've washed your feet.</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">For
    once Hanger Down clump was avoided, as the trail headed back
    down towards the woods, where the stillness of the night was
    shattered by an eerie whining noise. No, it wasn't Deadly this
    time, but HT2 trying out her new 'hi-tech' hash horn (as the
    first female hash horn shouldn't she be a hornet?). This device
    (the horn, not HT2), can reproduce the sirens of police cars,
    ambulances, fire engines etc. This could lead to confusion, so
    if you find yourself following a flashing light and siren down
    the road at high speed you know you're 'On' - it'll be HT2 with
    her siren and flashing bow tie.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We were then gored by
    gorse and got bogged down in bogs, before heading for the woods.
    F Ferret tried to second guess the hare and headed off in the
    wrong direction. He was not seen again for a very, very long
    time. No-one appeared to be worried, however, as ferrets often
    get lost chasing hares. Cream Soda, Drake H3's answer to David
    Attenborough, had got a way into the woods before realising that
    the calls he had been following were being made by an owl. He
    then had to find the best way to get down from the tree (of course,
    you don't get down from a tree - you get down from a duck).</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">After
    providing the hounds with a few nasty shocks, it was the turn
    of the hare, Yokelbonker, to get his own shock, when HT2 asked
    him if he was enjoying being Grand Master (so few committee members
    had turned up recently that some people thought GM stood for
    'Gone Missing'). Yokelbonker said nothing for quite a while,
    then asked &quot;Am I GM?!!!&quot;. It would seem that being
    GM is like having B.O. - even your best friends won't tell you.</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The
    evening's entertainment reached a high point with a bit of impromptu
    slurry surfing. This was a gentle introduction to Helen and Sarah
    to the more esoteric delights of hashing. They must have looked
    sorry for themselves as Slo-Jo opened a gate for them - an unprecedented
    honour. Finally the road was reached and after deciphering a
    cryptic arrow there was a stamped to the cars. No-one said it
    was a good hash - the hare would have heard - but it was.</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The
    On Down was at the Cornwood Inn where Saddam Hussein appeared
    to be serving behind the bar. This is his real job, he moonlights
    as a tyrant and despot in his spare time. Someone commented that
    the hash now appears to consist of landrover club or golf club
    members, but at least they have one thing in common: they both
    abuse their drivers! Mimi appears to be suffering from post-GM
    withdrawal symptoms. Could it be that he is looking for a post
    on the committee? Deputy Hash Hound has been suggested.</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Deadly
    announced that Maximouse is now British Night Orienteering champion.
    So now you know who to follow in future, but please remember
    - the Simpsons don't come if it's raining. Rover, back from who
    knows where, was collecting hash mags and claiming the title
    of hash archivist. It was mentioned that hash archaic was more
    appropriate. Hotfingers says that she is being bothered by nuisance
    telephone calls. Apparently IAT rings her every night for information
    about Yokelbonker. Don't ask why, just thank your lucky stars
    it's not you he's phoning - you can't get more of a nuisance
    call than having IAT ring you, whatever the subject!</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Endosperm
    managed to put his foot in it by mentioning to HT2 and Deadly
    that there was only one beautiful woman at Deadly's wedding.
    Bart and Ducky were much in evidence and taking their committee
    duties very seriously - unfortunately no-one else did. Mimi says
    that Wendy has come up with a hash name for Bart's pal, Neil
    - Rhino. Rhino Neil. It's time that Mike had a hash name and
    I suggest he should be called Bejabbers. After all, his wife
    is known as <I>Yakky</I>-dah, so he must be Be-<I>jabbers</I>.
    Yakkydah and Bejabbers what a combination!</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">After
    the Ovalteenies had left a few diehards made the climb up to
    the Mountain Inn at Lutton, where we found the hash archaic ensconced
    at the bar. He appeared to be drinking from a length of steel
    tube, possibly an oil pipe. Maybe this is why he calls himself
    an oilman!</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"

    of your mower and sprinkle whisky on your lawn - that way the
