    insanity or too much beer means that your Scribe-Mistress has
    been landed with the words this week. How come Rover got out
    of it<I> </I>again? Could it be that he<I> </I>is too tall for
    me to look him firmly in the eye, or is he just too good at excuses?!!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Well from Bedford Bridge Mudflaps laid what must
    have been the cleanest/driest run in a long time, and despite
    her temporarily forgetting where she'd laid the trail around
    Long Ash, it was a thoroughly enjoyable hash. I.A.T. may have
    thought otherwise. Yes, the silly old b..... did it again and
    took one of his famous short cuts, which led him downstream to
    Grenofen, while we were going upstream to Magpie Bridge! After
    a small search party was set up ( we're such a caring hash!),
    Begorrah found a soggy footed but unrepentant I.A.T. Of course,
    it's never his fault!! So whose turn is it to lose him next week
    ?<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Fluff and Mark's wedding went really well, with
    several of the Hash in attendance. Zippy was on form after many
    pints of Bass, and several ladies found this madly gyrating figure
    dancing with them, whether they wanted him to or not!!!!! On
    Monday evening (at yet another social event...yes, we live the
    high life in Hoo Meavy!), he was complaining of a bruised chest,
    the result of a collision with something unknown, whilst walking
    Zoe (Not Medlock) home. He maintains that he was a perfect gentleman
    throughout! Maybe it was his exertions (that's one way to put
    it!), that caused him to miss the Chagford Two Hills Race record
    by just one second! What a shame! Well done to Tinkerbell who
    was second lady in the same race, and to Deadly who remembering
    his great age, walked the course with his eight year old lad.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Well enough of this waffle....After showing my
    last poetic hash mag to my big bruv, he suggested that I shouldn't
    give up my day job, and forwarded his own rhyme for inspiration.
    It goes to the tune of 'Ghost Riders in the Sky'.....so all together
    now!!!<BR>
<BR>
    A fit young lad went running out one dark and windy day,<BR 
    CLEAR="ALL">And on a tor he rested as he went upon his way,<BR
    CLEAR="ALL">Then all at once through the mist a harassed figure
    he did spy,<BR CLEAR="ALL">Trying to lay a devious trail for
    that hash up in the sky.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL"><I>Chorus</I>: Yipee ei aye, yipee ei oh, Ghost
    Hashers in the Sky!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Its Reeboks were made of iron and its muscles
    made of steel,<BR CLEAR="ALL">And through a cloud of sawdust,
    its hot breath he could feel,<BR CLEAR="ALL">Then he saw the
    pack a coming hard and heard their frantic yell,<BR CLEAR="ALL">Back
    check you short cutting bastard for that on on down in hell.<BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL"><I>Chorus</I>: Yippee ei aye, yipee ei oh, Ghost
    Hashers in the Sky!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    With heavy lungs and blood-shot eyes, their kit all soaked in
    sweat,<BR CLEAR="ALL">They've been trying hard to catch that
    hare, but they ain't caught it yet<I>,</I><BR CLEAR="ALL">So
    they've got to run forever on that trail up in the sky,<BR CLEAR="ALL">Where
    2On On'&quot; and &quot;Where's that effing sawdust?&quot;, is
    their constant cry.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL"><I>Chorus</I>: Yipee ei aye, yipee ei oh, Ghost
    Hashers in the Sky!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    As the pack panted on by him, he heard one call his name,<BR
    CLEAR="ALL">If you like muck and ale on Monday nights, then hashing
    is your game,<BR CLEAR="ALL">So young man change your ways today
    and with us you can jog,<BR CLEAR="ALL">Trying to stay on sawdust
    through the bracken and the bog.<BR>
