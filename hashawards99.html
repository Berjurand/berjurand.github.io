    Award </FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    There were two sets of candidates for this award: Squelcher &amp;
    Bouncer for their Badgers Holt run which involved a liberal helping
    of gorse and a huge hill in a two<BR>
    pronged attack on the legs and lungs, and Donkey &amp; Denim
    for their Kit Hill gorse &amp;<BR>
    bramble run on 22 November. In the end it was no contest - the
    sheer sustained torture of the Kit Hill run won out in the end.
    The hounds suffered and the hares enjoyed watching, so the S
    &amp; M award goes to Donkey &amp; Denim.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Outstanding
    Contribution to Creative Hashing Award</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    There was only one real contender in this category, as normally
    the only time the average Drake hasher is creative is when they&#146;re
    trying to get out of laying a run! We&#146;ve run in certain
    places many times, so it takes a real talent to do something
    new in one of these locations. To get the hash lost at Burrator
    Reservoir is an achievement in itself, but to get them lost within
    the boundary of the reservoir demonstrates real genious. Step
    forward Chucky, your run on 1 November was a classic!</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Outstanding
    Value in Hashing Award </FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1"
     FACE="Arial"><BR>
    A closely contested category: We had runs from Wimpers at Holbeton
    Point that lasted 1 hour 10 minutes, IAT above Clearbrook at
    1 hour 10 minutes, and Squawk, Donkey &amp; Olive at Cremyll
    at 1 hour 11 minutes. But in the end, for sheer value for money,
    how can you beat a run which had two start points, a secret beer
    stop so secret no one could find it and two on downs. This year&#146;s
    Outstanding Value in Hashing Award therefore goes to Bouncer
    &amp; Squelcher for their Bedford Bridge / Lopwell Dam run on
    22 March 1999.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"></FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Special Awards<BR

    </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Derriford
    Hospital Injury of the Year Award</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    Previously this category was much more closely contested, with
    Not Norman and HT2 attending out patients for their injuries
    on the same night. Subsequently, things have been much quieter
    - however, IAT would have won it outright if that wire had not
    stopped him falling down that mine shaft. This year, however,
    there is only one serious contender for the award: After completing
    Rudolph&#146;s run at Lopwell Dam on 9 August she ended up in
    Derriford&#146;s out patients department with displaced kneecaps.
    She will be returning to hashing in the spring, when she hopes
    that like the birds, her kneecaps will be migrating north again.
    And so this year&#146;s Derriford Hospital Injury Award of the
    Year goes to Miss Whiplash.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Panzer Tank
    Award 1999</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    This award goes the person who has demonstrated the most innovative
    approach to tact and diplomacy over the year. To get things done
    even on Drake hash you need someone who is persuasive and who
    will seize opportunities. This person takes this one stage further
    by persuading you that you really would like to lay a trail in
    a month&#146;s time, whilst seizing you by the throat or any
    other vulnerable part of your anatomy. She personifies the spirit
    of this award because, like a panzer tank, she batters down your
    defences and rolls right over you, leaving you crushed and broken
    in her wake. However, it has been a long time since the hare
    list has been in such a healthy position and so she deserves
    this award for a job well done. The Panzer Tank Award 1999 goes
    to Dishy.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Percy Vearance
    Award 1999</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    It was many years ago that dear old Percy instigated this award
    for loyalty to the hash. <BR>
    The winner is someone who has turned out on a Monday night come
    rain or shine for<BR>
    many years now. Although never a front runner, she has stuck
    with the hash even when it was much faster than it is now. It
    is the middle and back of the pack runners like her who are the
    backbone of the hash and it is our aim to encourage as many of
    these people to join and stay with the club. This award is in
    recognition of her loyalty over the years and is presented in
    the hope that she will continue to run with Drake for many years
    to come. The Percy Vearance Award 1999 goes to Mudflaps.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Loony of the
    Year Award</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">
<BR>
    This was an extremely hotly contested award, in fact, everyone
    in the room was in contention for it. The judges had an extremely
    hard task picking just one loony from such a superb collection,
    but in the end it was for a single act of outstanding looniness
    for which the award was given. Imagine it&#146;s three o&#146;clock
    in the morning on New Year&#146;s Eve and you&#146;re tucked
    up snug and warm in bed. Now, what&#146;s the looniest thing
    you could do? Get out of bed, go outdoors into the cold, wet
    and dark and run 76 miles across Dartmoor just to get back to
    where you first started from. No one in their right mind would
    do such a thing, and so Loony of the Year award goes to Zippy.
    Those members of the hash who assisted him receive the title
    of &#145;Assistant Loony&#146;, in the hope that in due course
    they too may aspire to full looniness.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Lifetime Achievement
    Award</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    This special award has been created for those who have made the
    most outstanding<BR>
    contribution to Drake hash over the years. The winner is someone
    who has become a<BR>
    legend in hash circles and whose name is spoken with awe (Awe
    it&#146;s him). He has<BR>
    single-handedly invented an alternative to conventional navigation
    and has taken every opportunity to promote it. His local knowledge
    is peerless, in fact, he is the one person who knows the area
    like the back of his hand, whilst staring at his palm. He is
    responsible for devising the longest short cuts ever created,
    and has achieved remarkable success in persuading other hashers
    to join him on them. His experience is<BR>
    unrivalled: he has been lost at virtually every location where
    Drake has run. On one<BR>
    memorable occasion in the Teign Valley woods, he told the hare
    that the trail did not<BR>
    go where it had been laid and headed off in the opposite direction.
    Several hours later<BR>
    he turned up at the pub after accosting a farmer in his home
    and forcing him to give him a lift to the pub. His powers of
    persuasion verge on the hypnotic. On another occasion he was
    so worried for the hare&#146;s safety in the dark whilst he was
    being rescued that he was forced to hold the hare&#146;s hand.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The attention
    to detail and the effort that this man puts into his trails reflects
    his<BR>
    perfectionism. It is we, the all too fallable hounds, who are
    to blame if a trail does not<BR>
    go entirely to plan, by not following every single blob of sawdust
    that has been laid. And it is only for our own good that he is
    forced to shout at us. His trail laying skills are at such a
    high level that they are completely beyond the comprehension
    of the average hasher, which accounts for the failure of the
    hounds to locate any of the sawdust that he had so cunningly
    hidden behind stones in one of his early Drake runs at Shaugh
    Bridge.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Finally, he is
    a real character and has contributed tremendously to the spirit
    of Drake<BR>
    Hash House Harriers since its inception. He is a real hasher
    and will always be so.<BR>
    I am proud to announce that the winner of The Lifetime Achievement
    Award (which confers upon the recipient Life Membership of Drake
    H3) goes to IAT.</FONT></P>
