    was a bit more woodwork creeping going on this week. The evening
    started well, with a heated discussion in the car park at Cadover
    Bridge with Old Ferret's brother type person (very fit; marathon
    in ten minutes, five hour run before breakfast etc.), either
    to wear duo layer laminate Goretex integrally ventilated all
    weather system or kecky old dish cloth his mum knitted. The decision
    paled into insignificance later on as he discovered, whilst trailing
    Zippy's heels, that the torch kindly leant to him by his brother
    was as about as bright as the collective intelligence of the
    entire Drake hash. i.e. not.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">&quot;The
    long is quite long&quot;. Thus spoke Skippy. After a bit of foot
    wetting in the Plym, the long persons duly disappeared around
    the side of some great lump into the boondocks, leaving the shorts
    and those recovering from over indulgent holidays to meander
    up to the Trowelsworthy tors. We were rewarded on top by a fine
    sunset and a finely reasoned discourse from Dishy upon the art
    of following a hash and why you do not have to zealously follow
    every bloody bit of sawdust. It was probably prompted by Skippy
    moaning: &quot;Why don't people follow the sawdust? - waste of
    time laying it - taken all that trouble - dust gets everywhere
    - simply not appreciated&quot; etc.etc. No different from what
    every hare says every week. Rearrange these words to form a sentence:
    blame, the, I, hare.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Nobody was
    told that it was Limpalong's birthday until everyone was well
    inside the Moorland Hotel at Wotter. Poor old bugger was probably
    scared of being baptised in the Plym if anyone found out earlier.
    As it was, he narrowly escaped having his forehead used as a
    recyclable greetings card when Rover found himself with a felt
    pen in his hand. But El Limpo bought us all a drink, so he is
    a very nice man. A very very nice man.</FONT></P>
