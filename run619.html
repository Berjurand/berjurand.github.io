     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">By any other Hash standards, this year's
    Drake Committee take some beating; by Drake standards it is a
    vintage year of disorganisation. Our star man, Thirsty Glass,
    upon returning from his summer sabbatical to Blackpool, where
    incidentally he came second in the Princess Di look alike competition,
    discovered he had mislaid the Hash holy grail, namely the Hash
    list. Now we can get by in spite of most of the committees cock-ups,
    but Thirsty knows he has really scored this time. He has therefore
    decided to emigrate. Yes, he's gone west in the footsteps of
    Bruce. Can Cornwall handle this pair, and what about Bruce?</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Other
    Hashers of scholarly persuasion arrived at Shipley Bridge on
    this cool damp night, after lengthy summer absences. Crawling
    out of the woodwork was one comment I heard, which I thought
    was particularly unkind in relation to Guinness, but pretty apt
    for the Old Ferret particularly because he takes more short cuts
    than Begorrah.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We saw the most reliable sign that winter
    is not too far away. Mudflaps, who has been known to shiver in
    July, had the full cold weather outfit on, and didn't appear
    to relish the thought of a Limpalong/Dishy/Mole co-production
    trail. Runs from here have a benevolent predictability; a bit
    like meeting an old friend - Deadly excluded. Limpalong even
    got away again with the round Shipley Bridge/into the bog/over
    the stream start, which put Deadly in super whinge mode for the
    rest of the night. It did not catch out Anonymouse who wasn't
    going to fall for that nonsense.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There was a lot of heavy
    breathing as we climbed up to the filtration station taking in
    a couple of checks. In fact there was some gasping and Skippy
    said she would tell me later what was the cause. Ziggy, Thirsty
    and Anon led at speed to the check at the bottom of Bala Brook
    and the trail restarted up the other side. IAT did a mega short
    cut here as did Begorrah, but Twice-A-Night followed the trail;
    she said she liked it in the ferns. Coming back over the stream
    there was the long climb up Zeal Hill, otherwise known as Dishy's
    revenge. We got a bit strung out over the hill top, and the checks
    were found fairly easily. Limpalong played one of his cunning
    little stunts in the gully down to the Avon, with the front runners
    disappearing up their own fundamentals. The check at the bottom,
    led to a restart over the road and up to Dockwell Ridge. It was
    dusk now and the third check up the hill really stuffed FFerret,
    Deadly and Ziggy, who all subsequently got into trouble in those
    bloody rhododendrons at the bottom! SNM - Say No More.</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A
    race then back to the cars, and a convivial evening in the Packhorse.
    Here there was much talk of toads, testicles and pickled eggs.
    Twice-A-Night said she just picked one up, Skippy said she had
    never kissed one, and IAT had apparently just trodden on one.
    It was all very confusing, not helped by the beer. Deadly just
    can't help trying to 'impress' Skippy, but she doesn't seem to
    mind and even Limpalong joined in.</FONT></P>
