    The fame of Drake Hash House Harriers in days gone by, the daring
    feats of those heroes is well known to us. And so they came to
    Soussons Forest when lesser folk cowered by their firesides,
    shunning the night outside. A vast and eerie night it was, when
    the great mist wraith came unbidden to Dartmoor's slopes, crawling
    over forest and moor, squeezing the land in its spectral grasp
    until all was obliterated in the fathomless mirk.</FONT><BR 
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">And
    were they dismayed? No, not they, not Endosperm, HT2, F Ferret,
    Deadly, IAT, Cream Soda, Zippy, Heinz, Muscles, Mimi, Begorrah,
    Yakkidah, Schweppes, Anonymouse, Megamouth, Mudflaps, Minimouse,
    Not Norman, Yokelbonker, Hobnails, Carol, Kirsty, Rambo, Doris,
    John &amp; Limpalong. For these hashers were true kin of Drake;
    their bodies strong and quick, with hearts of fire and minds
    of ice. They faced the night and were undaunted.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Eager
    they were, like hounds scenting a stag, like a peregrine at its
    stoop, they hastened to the trail. And as they ran their soaring
    spirits found tongue, and the forest rang with their shouts.
    Then the gloom reached out to them, only to recoil as darkness
    was put to flight by the brilliance of the hashers' dancing torches.</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">But
    it was an evil place they had come to: Where the ground clawed
    and dragged at them, whereupon was revealed a sea of branches.
    Where quagmires lurked to claim the unwary in jaws of mud. A
    subtle enchantment existed there, fogging their minds, confusing
    their sense of direction, until they found themselves running
    but travelling little.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">And so it was by devious
    means that they were led from the true path and onto false trails.
    But one alone was not misled. He that is known as Zippy penetrated
    the web of falsehood and by his might ran the trail down. His
    companions in their bewilderment stood and wondered and sorely
    did they curse.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Then in the depths of the night a marvel
    was revealed. In far off times the heart of the forest had been
    pierced by a Golden Dagger that caused the Earth's heart blood
    to flow, and each drop was a tree. Thus the Earth bleeds root
    and branch, sap and leaf - a marvel indeed.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Many
    were the adventures they had, those hashers and many were the
    wonders they saw on their journey homeward, but these I must
    leave for another time.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Weary they were on their
    return but still their spirits burned bright, and proudly did
    they bear the scars of their ordeal. Then they made for an alehouse
    that in these parts was known as The East Dart. Great was the
    rejoicing that night, and high was the praise for Begorrah and
    Schweppes and for the trail. And to them was given The Champion's
    Portion.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Then in fellowship tales were told and
    extravagant boasts made of exploits past and to come. I have
    never heard of a greater band of runners gathered with such dignity.
    Then the glorious hashers sat on the mead benches, rejoicing
    in the feast. Courteously together they quaffed many an ale cup,
    confident hashers in that high hall. The East Dart was packed
    with feasters who were friends, and therein lay their strength.
    For true fellowship is a precious gift, freely given, whenever
    hashers meet.</FONT></P>
