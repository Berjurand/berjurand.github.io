     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Last week from the gloom of the Plume
    of Doom there came a frantic cry: &quot;I want a scribe&quot;.
    In my younger days it used to be &quot;I gotta horse&quot;. I
    did the only thing a gentleman would do, I hid. Alas my wife
    volunteered my services: &quot;He knows his A B C and can do
    joined up writing&quot; she said. Accolades flow from my wife's
    mouth like sludge from a slurry pit. Enough of my verbal diarrhoea,
    here's the post mortem on run 359 from Minions on Beastly Bodmin
    Moor.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The first question I ask is where was everybody?
    Could it be that you are all frightened of the natives of Cornwall?
    You all missed an excellent run, very well organised, well marked
    over some interesting terrain. So interesting in fact that I
    cam across Slo-Jo on her hands and knees with Cream Soda looking
    at some luminous lichen. She said afterwards that I.A.T. kept
    telling her to lie flat on the ground. The mind boggles! <BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">It was comforting to have so many
    checks, it gives one a chance to get one's breath back and to
    observe the mad keen hashers darting about all over the place.
    It was during one of these checks that I noticed that Endosperm
    and HT2 had odd socks on. I wonder where they changed! <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">If you thought the marshy ground was wet last week
    those of you that didn't turn up (shame), should have seen what
    we went through. Bart, who laid the trail, either went through
    on stilts or he has bloody long arms. Minder loved it, but didn't
    he stink afterwards! For once, we missed Deadly, his carping
    wit, or whingeing - whatever you like to call it, could have
    reverberated off the rocks. I understand though that the poor
    fellow has the flu. Interestingly enough, so has the Farting
    Ferret. Do they perhaps sleep together I wonder? <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">Having for the first time completed a run without
    taking any short cuts and having been coerced into doing the
    long run by HT2, I was justifiably proud at the end, only to
    be brought back to earth by Denim who announced it was too slow.
    Perhaps we should set her one that crosses the M5 motorway, that
    would speed it up a bit and keep her moving! <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">I understood from Mimi that Mrs Mimi can't come to
    the Hash because she is rehearsing for a pantomime. What's the
    difference? A bigger pantomime you couldn't wish to see every
    Monday night of the year, and we don't rehearse!!</FONT></P>
