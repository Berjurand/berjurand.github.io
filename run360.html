    I had a new ribbon in my word processor I volunteered to scribe
    - no I cannot tell a lie (not yet anyway) - no-one else would
    do it. I had two offers of lifts to the hash this week, last
    week I only got one and that was withdrawn when Dumbo and Rudolf-San
    decided to run with Tamar Valley H3 - and haven't been seen since!
    It was a difficult<BR>
    decision to make at my time of life: I could ride in the luxurious
    comfort of a modern Volvo listening to the sophisticated conversation
    of El Pee and arrive twenty minutes after the Hash had started,
    thus spending the next forty minutes vainly looking for them,
    or I could spend an uncomfortable half an hour in an ancient
    Land-Rover with the wind whistling from the rear, being seduced
    by Minder and listening to the disconnected<BR>
    ramblings of Mimi. I pondered for a full fifteen seconds - and
    not being sound of mind and body chose the latter!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    At Holbeton Point we gathered in eager anticipation (well anticipation
    anyway). Deadly was back but Hugh still had the flugh, as also
    did Schweppes. Yokelbonker had arrived early and finding nobody
    there had driven back along the track until finding his way barred
    by Cream Soda's pantechnicon. Last week's hare and scribe were
    both missing - were they afraid to face the music? Slo-Jo arrived
    from the opposite direction to everyone else (a privilege of
    the ruling class), and at 7.32 we set off.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    No doubt you will all have differing memories of the run, which
    hopefully you will keep to yourselves. Mine consisted mainly
    of trying to keep up with Cream Soda, listening to the latest
    orienteering score between Deadly and Wimpers - at one point
    it was 3-3, and following the latest exploits of Yesman and Dig-in,
    the deadly duo from the Trustee Savings Bank. Dig-in has been
    training with the Territorial Army EH and is our last line of
    defence should there be war in the Gulf.</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If the worst was to happen he would be
    dispatched with pen and ruler to the front where he would open
    a branch of the T.S.B. (The Sand Bank?) causing so much confusion
    within the Iraqi Army that they would reteat in disorder.Yesman
    has been participating in Executive training in Wiltshire learning
    how to sack branch managers. It's a simple process: first take
    one branch manager, then fire him, then re-hire him at half the
    salary - this is called re-cycling. To date Yesman has re-cycled
    fifty six out of fifty eight (the other two are relatives - they're
    not going to be re-cycled - just fired).<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR 
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    As the management of the Mildmay Colours were non persona gratis
    with Hubcaps, the On Down was at the Dartmoor Union where HT2
    (attempting to live up to her namesake) did her best to make
    the Hash n.p.g. with the management by pouring beer down Yesman's
    back, whereupon he turned round and poured his over Deadly's
    head, most of which ended up on a chair (the beer, not Deadly's
    head). The Landlady was not amused and it took several big brown
    pots and grotti noshes to calm her down.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Wimpers, Snakehips,Yokelbonker and Slo-Jo were
    in a corner talking about military matters. Wimpers has received
    instructions to report to the Gulf (see copy attached). El Pee
    was in another corner with his big brown pot - waiting for his
    food order. Popeye and Olive-Oil made their usual departure and
    when asked why they were leaving, Popeye said he had to get some.
    I didn't find out what. Mates might know. <BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Attempts have been made to link me with Foggy
    Dewhurst from BBC's Last Of The Summer Wine. Well two can play
    at that game! Who do we know who drives a Land-Rover, has his
    head permanently under the bonnet of a car and is always in overalls?
    For all we know his wife also makes him walk on newspapers over
    her kitchen floor! Any look-a-likes for the rest of the cast,
    I wonder? Wesley (sorry-Mimi) wants the following notice printed
    - I can't think why:</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR

    Rumours that recent tests have proved that a fully sequined effigy
    of Deadly will not burn are completely unfounded. Sequins kindly

    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Under the Emergency
    Powers Act 1939 (as amended by the Defence Act 1978), you are
    hereby notified that you are required to place yourself on standby
    for possible compulsory military service in the Gulf Conflict.
    You may shortly be given orders to depart for Saudi Arabia where
    you will join either the Third Battalion Queens Own Suicidal
    Conscripts or the Third Foot &amp; Mouth.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Due to cutbacks in Government expenditure in
    recent years it will be necessary for you to provide yourself
    with the following equipment as soon as possible:<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"></FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Combat
    jacket<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    Trousers (preferably khaki)<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    Tin helmet<BR CLEAR="ALL">Boots (or sturdy trainers)<BR CLEAR="ALL">Gas
    mask<BR CLEAR="ALL">A map of the combat zone (the Ordnance Survey
    1:25000 Outdoor Leisure Map of Iraq will do)<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    A rifle <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>

     COLOR="#ffffff">If you can afford it, we would also like you
    to buy a tank - Vickers Defence at Barnbow are currently offering
    our conscripts a 0% finance deal on all new H-Reg Chieftains,
    while stocks last.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">We would like to reassure you that if anything
    should go wrong you will receive a free burial in the graveyard
    of your choice, and your widow will be entitled to the new War
    Widows Pension of &pound;1.75 per calendar month (subject to
    means testing). <BR CLEAR="ALL">There may be little time for
    formal military training before you depart, so you are advised
    to hire videos of the following war films and try to pick up
    a few ideas as you watch: The Guns of Navarone, Kelly's Heroes,
    A Bridge Too Far, The Longest Day, Henry V, Blazing Saddles,
    The Sound of Music etc. Alternatively, if you cannot get hold
    of these, any old John Wayne rubbish will do.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">To mentally prepare yourself for your mission, try
    reading the works of Wilfred Owen or Rupert Brooke. This should
    give you some idea of what may be involved.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
