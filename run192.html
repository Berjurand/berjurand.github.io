    </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Tavistock
    Woodlands Estate at Carthamartha was the venue for this joint
    Drake H3 / TransVestite (sometimes known as Tamar Valley) H3
    hash. A location specifically<BR>
    chosen in revenge for all those previous reunions at Mothecombe.
    However, none of Drake H3 sulked off for a lap of Burrator Reservoir.
    There were some notable absentees, perhaps this run was a cure
    for diarrhoea.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Eventually, sixteen Drake hashers replete
    with maps, ropes, torches, bivi bags, emergency rations etc.,
    reached the parking field - there were surely some who did not
    make it........ The Odds were assessed as 3:1 against but this
    lengthened to 5:1 as the convoy of Tamar Valley H3 latecomers
    filed into the field. When even Bloodnock could wait no longer,
    the customary briefing was delivered: &quot;Shut the gates,when
    near sheep, keep all dogs on leads, we're using some Private
    parts, loads of bullocks etc.&quot;</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Just
    as we were falling asleep, the direction of the first check was
    given and so the pack charged off through the gateway and over
    the car which was in it. After two miles of track we entered
    the woods and began checking. There were several possible trails
    and all the check-backs were a long way out, as was the 'ON'
    arrow. This pattern was<BR>
    repeated throughout the run which gave the keenies plenty of
    chances to increase the training mileage.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Drake
    H3 spread in all directions at the checks whereas Tavistock Athletic
    Club held hands on the most level route that they could find
    and the Tamar Valley H3 wounded, notably Glani &amp; Westlake,
    used what little local knowledge they had, combined with even
    less collective brain power, to find the short cuts. Our method
    worked for the first few checks until your scribe got stranded
    on a long check-back, then caught in the<BR>
    jungle before intercepting the last arrivals whom Bloodnock had
    sent on a loop which everyone else had missed.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Next
    came the inevitable fording of the River Inny within sight of
    the footbridge and a series of checks leading uphill to what
    Cream Soda considered to be the climax of the run. This was a
    check with crosses on all the trails with more sawdust and crosses
    beyond: This should have been the ultimate regroup but you can
    rely on hashers to **** it up. A new World Record may well have
    been established for time taken to sort a check out as the hounds
    ran around in total confusion. Some returned from the correct
    trail more than once, F Ferret set a new Personal Best for getting
    hopelessly lost, Sturmer went up the pole, others gave in and
    when we eventually called &quot;ON! ON!&quot; many turned and
    ran away.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Soon afterwards the groupies at the parking
    field heard simultaneous shouts from all over the woods from
    several bunches of runners doing their own versions of the trail.
    We encountered a check on every junction (I got them ALL wrong),
    then headed down a lane, through some fields, back into the woods
    and across the river once more. Great! The finish must be near,
    we thought, momentarily forgetting it was back on the very top
    of the hill.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">The keenies were
    now ready for the race home but the hares had other ideas: First
    came the only real shiggy of the evening, then some false trails
    and disorientating twists before a grassy overgrown track led
    up to the sky. Deadly got to the front briefly, until he was
    passed by some real runners who were undeterred by the flailing
    arms and legs of a once useful veteran orienteer. He should do
    well in the next Harrods sale. Staggering out onto a forest road
    an arrow was spotted pointing downhill again. The leaders of
    the pack stood in stunned silence and then drifted dutifully
    off towards the river again. Well, at least the stupid ones did!
    We had obviously rejoined the outward route and so your scribe,
    quite rightly in these circumstances, ignored the arrow and headed
    for home. Those on the second lap must have wondered who had
    kicked out the check marks for them.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The
    On Down was at the 'Hare &amp; Hounds' at Chip Shop, could there
    be anywhere more appropriate? This place is miles from any form
    of civilization except Endosperm's brother - well, not life as
    we know it perhaps, but close enough - a tremendous relief to
    someone who did not have to navigate back to Plymouth after repeating
    his performance from the recent 'Abject Squalor' Thrash. An early
    departure for the pub after the run was essential to ensure swift
    service before the masses arrived and more time was gained by
    choosing to follow the right car. As expected, the On Down was
    too crowded, too noisy, too hot etc. but most people seemed to
    be enjoying themselves. A good finish to an excellent evening's
    entertainment.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><B><FONT
