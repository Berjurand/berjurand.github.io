    the hash assembled once more for a run at Norsworthy Bridge,
    we heard something of the trials and tribulations of the hares.
    Yet again IAT? had turned up with his wheelbarrow to carry the
    sawdust for the trail - he tried this on me once at Cadover Bridge,
    but I'd been firm with him and stopped that sort of nonsense.
    I'm afraid that Not Norman indulged him and so this unlikely
    couple were to be seen making their way through and around the
    woods, the wheel squeaking every third revolution and Norman
    pretending he wasn't there when anyone came into view.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Amazingly, there were twenty brave souls who
    were prepared to risk life and limb on an IAT / Not Norman run.
    Noby Dick's girls turned up again, one is called Slug and the
    other Rover. It was immediately obvious that Rover was the one
    with the long hair (well, whoever heard of a slug with long hair).
    This causes a bit of a problem as we were just getting to know
    Brian L as Rover - we can't have two of them so we'll just have
    to call him Lassie. George was actually running again, but still
    can't persuade Mervyn to return. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Making
    a welcome return was Hopeless, who must have wondered at the
    wisdom of her decision, as within thirty yards of the off we
    were being instructed not to step on the rocks in the river as
    they were slippery - the alternative, of course, was to wade
    across. As we headed up beside the river, ducking, weaving and
    stumbling, we feared that we'd have to cross back over it again,
    but no, the trail led us out to the lane, where we checked through
    the gate. Wimpers, whose headlamp was to prove invaluable throughout
    the run, found sawdust leading into the woods and back up to
    the track coming out to the check by the leat.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">Those with plenty of experience at orienteering in
    these woods were ticking off all the usual routes. From here
    there is one absolutely ghastly muddy rutted track that goes
    along to the next bridge. It goes without saying that this was
    the one on which sawdust was found. We headed back across the
    leat again and followed a decent track to an old ruin at the
    edge of the woods. We found sawdust going up beside the river
    whilst the hares sneaked the girls (and HT and El Pee) across
    the river and into the woods. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">It
    was rough going up river and after crossing it was even rougher
    through the tin workings coming back. From this point on it can
    be fairly said that the running surface<BR>
    deteriorated. Abdul set the ball rolling by falling into a hole,
    and, as he struggled to get out he was loud in condemnation of
    Norman (we knew Norman was to blame as we had been out for longer
    than thity five minutes). In fact from now on a stranger hearing
    us could well have been forgiven for thinking that 'Norman' was
    a particularily unpleasant swear word. Upon returning to the
    woods after a sortie up hill and back down again, the said Norman
    was discovered &quot;Sitting there like a little gnome, all he
    needed was a fishing rod&quot;. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">We
    struggled up what the hares obviously considered a track and
    from this point on Richard was reported to be falling down every
    ten yards instead of occasionally. We made our hesitant way througn
    the brashings (anyone who can define brashings without using
    a four letter word gets this week's star prize). Endosperm chased
    a cow but was unlucky - in future he's going to stick to sheep!<B><BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL"></B>After coming out to the moor we were back
    to the bogs (the hares were showing no mercy) with the Long /
    Short split coming up. The girls (HT and LP) went back through
    the woods led by IAT?(!) whilst we made our way up a wet gully
    to the check on the Devonport Leat, and yes, the wheelbarrow
    had been up here as well! A false trail stranded most of the
    hounds on the wrong side of the leat, much to Norman's amusement.
    We trotted along beside the leat nearly all the way to Crazy
    Well Pool (but not close enough so that we could have thrown
    Norman in) and then turned back home to make for the bucket.
    Norman twisted his ankle shortly afterwards so our spirits were
    uplifted as we negotiated the twists turns and double backs followed
    by some awful clitter (all that clitters is bloody awful).<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The homeward trail took us through the woods
    along Raddick Lane and out to the track<BR>
    beside the wood. Lassie had no sooner said &quot;At last, now
    we can stretch our legs&quot;, when he fell over in spectacular
    style, but having ascertained that he had only broken his knee
    cap he was abandoned (well, he's got two weeks in Iraq to recover).
    Norman sent us back via the lane as we were late and we arrived
    back after seventy five minutes at the same time as the girls
    (and HT and LP) who had struggled back through the woods. IAT?
    was heard muttering something about &quot;All they want to do
    is talk about frocks&quot;. I suppose he was talking about HT
    and LP.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Back at the cars the tales of 'falling down'
    were recounted: The Farting Armpit, having worn his headlamp
    for the first time, reported falling down at the first rough
    stuff, then getting up again and promptly falling down once more
    - you've got to laugh. He says he's going to tie it on somewhere
    else, it'll be interesting to see where! Jimmy had done his usual
    job on several unfortunates. An excellent run and we have the
    scars to prove it. <BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">At the chipless Royal Oak, IAT? informed me that
    the Committee changes can only be carried out with an Extraordinary
    General Meeting, public demonstrations, democratic votes, freedom
    of the people, votes for frogs, etc., etc. He can put that in
    his wheelbarrow! He also claims he can't audit the Hash's books
    whilst there are entries in pencil. But how else can the books
    be balanced? My apologies to Jane for leaving her out of the
    new Committee list.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">An attempt by myself to get a Hash Bridge School
    together met with what is normally called 'a limited response'.
    If there are bodies who I did not reach who play or would like
    to learn please contact me. All else is forgotten except the
    Turkey Pie I had, and that was truly unforgettable!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><B>COMMITTEE
    MEETING - Tuesday 30th. Sept. (report of)</B><BR>
    The following subjects were dealt with when a word could be got
    in edgeways amongst the frivolous chatter:- <BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">a) The same as last year about this time - a
    meal is to be organised by Hubcaps -<BR>
    probably on Monday November 10th after a town run and possibly
    at Mr. Barrett's again.<BR>
    Cost about &pound;5 as before, but with more beer. Firm details
    later. Meanwhile book with<BR>
    Hubcaps so she has numbers to work with.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">b) There is about &pound;380 in the kitty allocated
    to various categories. And anything that is missing is in Abdul's
    garage. <BR CLEAR="ALL">c) To reduce the frequency of haring,
    experienced hares should have only one hare per run. Two hares
    will continue for girls and new / inexperienced hares. Instruction
    sheets for hares would be given to new members.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">d) Since HT refuses to give up his horn, Richard
    will buy another horn - it was suggested that a hunting horn
    would be more environmentally acceptable - there followed further
    suggestions as to where a hunting horn could be placed.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">e) A design for a 150th Run T-shirt is needed
    very urgently - please get your designs to Hubcaps or Diane as
    soon as possible.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">f) A design for a new sweat-shirt is also needed
    - not so urgent - but please let's have your ideas.</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">g)
    For a trial period of three months we are going to put an A4
    poster in various places in our catchment area. Again designs
    and suggestions please to Diane. Our numbers are a bit low for
    this time of year and new members are required.<BR>
    </FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">h)
    As we have done in previous winters, the occasional Sunday Run
    is looked forward to, either by using our own hares or running
    with another Hash when reasonably close (On Sec to keep in touch
    with other Hashes). Haremistresses to look for Hares.<BR>
    </FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">i)
    Tamar Valley H3 let the Dartmoor Rangers know when they are in
    their areas. They are then able to let the hares know if there
    any difficult land owners in the area proposed. It is also good
    Public Relations, as someday we may need their support. This
    system works well with Tamar Valley H3 and we would like to adopt
    it. It only takes a phone call. Deadly to publish Rangers telephone
    numbers and make sure they are on the instructions to hares.<BR>
    </FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">j)
    If Scribes need Snakehips to do photocopying for them they must
    get the originals to him by Thursday.<BR>
    </FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">k)
    PK is laying a run from the Imperial Hotel, Ivybridge (remember
    their curry) on Tuesday October 14th at 7.30pm - all welcome.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">l) Orienteering - the South West Gallopen in
    Plym Forest is being organised by Deadly,<BR>
    Snakehips and Wimpers. Richard, Norman, Endosperm and Cream Soda
    have already<BR>
    been volunteered to assist but further Hash volunteers would
    be welcome. See Deadly. Date Sunday November 16th.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">m) Endosperm had to put his foot down to get
    to the meeting - it was felt that it was about time Ciderlegs
    returned to the fold.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">n) A suggestion that we should affiliate to the
    Amateur Athletics Association did not receive much support. I
    see from the latest Tamar Valley H3 mag that they have discussed
    the same thing and their findings were that &quot;Initial enquiries
    show it is probably easier for individual hashers to join if
    they want to or join Tavistock Athletic Club&quot;.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">We seem to have fallen down on information re extra-mural
    runs - so if you know of Fun Runs, etc., give details to the
    scribe for that week or to Snakehips.</FONT></P>
