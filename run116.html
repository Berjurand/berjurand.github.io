    waited all week for the divine inspiration that all scribes pray
    for but few receive, I can delay no longer as the distaff half
    of the Grand Master is waiting for it (that's her problem -Ed.).
    It never ceases to amaze me how I'm Not Norman and I.A.T? managed
    to produce their bi-weekly drivel to such a consistent standard
    (mediocre? - Ed) and as<BR>
    for Cream Soda - he did it every week (maybe that's why he runs
    so funny).<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">This run started from the Lopes Arms in Roborough
    - a place that previously I had driven through only once (the
    wrong way!). At first we thought that the hares had forgotten
    the sawdust and were using that of the previous week as we retraced
    parts of the Arkle run. There were shades of deja vu as I found
    myself dogging the feet of Hubcaps and George in the direction
    of The George, but then we turned off down a little known (to
    us) footpath at the back of Glenholt. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">After
    a diversion into Glenholt itself we resumed our progress through
    West Wood, Barklake Wood and Common Wood(?). At one point a detour
    had to be made to avoid trespassing on private property, but
    since when has that bothered the hares! This took us through
    some particularly wet stuff and one had to keep a look out in
    case Baldric was in the vicinity. His torch was out of action
    and he made several attempts to steal someone else's. On reaching
    the dismantled railway line without having succeeded in getting
    a light, he lured an unsuspecting Cream Soda away from the rest
    of the hash and headed off in the direction of Bickleigh Bridge,
    not to be seen again until the On Down. One would have thought
    that a veteran of Cream Soda's experience would have known better,
    but anyone who spends his evenings playing chess with a computer
    to enable him to beat his fellow human beings can't be trusted
    to do the right thing!<B> <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"></B>The
    rest of us, having reached the viaduct, turned round and went
    back through the woods to Darklake Farm where a never-ending
    flight of steps took us to Bickleigh Down and up a lane to Roborough.
    At the back Non U Sara, Hopeless and your scribe walked in, but
    at the front it was no holds barred as I.S.S. and Deadly did
    their utmost to prevent Julia from beating them to the On Down.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">In the Lopes there was a distinct absence of
    Marines - so no tall tales of &quot;When I was in .......&quot;
    were to be heard, except for Brian who first hashed in Malaya.
    The hash divided itself into its usual cliques - Hubcaps and
    George, Baldric and El Pee (what is this hash coming to?), Hopeless
    and anyone who would buy her half a mild! It was nice to see
    both halves of the Grand Master there (personally I always thought
    Hopeless would make a grand mistress!).<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">'Revolting',
    otherwise known as 'Revolution', has been taken off at the A.B.C.
    cinema in Plymouth due to lack of support. This is in spite of
    I.A.T.? having been to every performance of the film in the hope
    that his ten second appearance as an extra in the aftermath of
    Yorktown battle would become longer each time he went!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Hopeless was heard whingeing in true G.M. fashion
    (wonder where she learnt that?) about checks not being rubbed
    out properly. This was her first whinge (she says) but no doubt
    it will not be her last! Please note that Sara 's (and Ali's)
    last name is spelt with no u after the Q. I hope that is quite
    clear. I think if I had a name that difficult to spell, I'd rather
    be the Man With No Name.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><B>HASH
