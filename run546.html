     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If I'd had the slightest idea that I'd
    be scribing tonight I'd certainly of taken more notice of what
    was going on in the hash. As it happens I went round it in some
    kind of muscular trance, suffering all the way after competing
    in a road race that very same day! (I'd forgotten how bloody
    boring they were). Anyway, back to the hash...<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">Only the select few gathered at Norsworthy Bridge
    car park for the Bank Holiday run. Obviously everyone else had
    found something better to do! Everyone was milling about hare-lessly
    until I remembered I was supposed to say something if Limpalong
    hadn't turned up. HT2 told me to tell everyone to follow the
    new fluffy stuff instead of the dull soggy stuff. (I don't think
    its fair to call our male hashers dull and soggy, do you)? Anyway,
    I said my bit and off they trotted following in the direction
    of a 'starter arrow'.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">To no surprise
    to me, the trail led up to Down Tor - or is that down to Up Tor?
    I overheard Skippy cursing to herself on the way up that this
    was worse than the Bodmin Five Tors Race she did a few weeks
    ago! She was trying to scramble up a near vertical E5 pitch without
    a safety line (The climbers of the hash will understand the technical
    terms). I gave her some verbal encouragement then we carried
    on. Our next obstacle off Down Tor was the 'usually' sedate stream
    running in the valley. As you may of guessed, it wasn't sedate
    in the slightest. On the contrary, it was big and flowing fast!
    I must admit to being a bit of a whimp here. After seeing Wild
    Bill expertly jump its width and only just survive, I decided
    to wade it instead. I think Skippy and Muscles did the same.
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Over the stream we hit upon some farmhouse ruins,
    where we re-grouped because the front runners couldn't find the
    check!! (Can't find the right staff these days)! Sub found it
    eventually and we all headed upwards....all but one that is:
    IAT had other ideas. He headed off in the opposite direction,
    at the same time trying to convince us that it was the obvious
    place for the trail to go! I don't need to add that we didn't
    see him for a while. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">The next
    obstacle that springs to mind is the precariously placed wobbly
    metal thing that spanned another 'fast flowing' stream. After
    watching Wild Bill balance carefully over it, I decided it would
    take my weight! I was half way across when Wild Bill started
    jumping up and down on it at the other end. Then to make matters
    worse, he made his way to the middle to where I was, and insisted
    on re-enacting that scene in Robin Hood with the poles. Can you
    image it??? We didn't have any poles, so I tried to fight him
    off with my new bell. The only reaction it got was that Wild
    Bill said it gave him earache.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It was about this time
    (half way through the hash) that I'd begun to notice a protective
    shepherd-type figure now and again. He was always poised patiently
    in prominent spots guiding the needy. The needy being the hashers
    near the rear. The figure would stand dominantly pointing us
    in the right direction after the front runners had selfishly
    left us for dead. This shepherd-like person was none other than
    our very own Snakehips. I don't even think he was under any special
    orders from the hares either, he was doing this out of the goodness
    of his heart!</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The bit I would protest at on the hash
    was the woods. It was awful because some people were putting
    on their lights far too early and ruining the night vision for
    everyone else, and secondly it was near impossible to run the
    woods - if you were foolish enough to try, odds on you'd slip
    on a slimy trunk and break your neck. I opted to follow Cream
    Soda, if he slipped I'd just walk over him!<BR>
    </FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Luckily,
    the woods didn't last too long. Great, I thought, no more annoying
    bits, but then what did we come up against? You guessed it, a
    bloody great big river. It was enormous. OK, so I'm exaggerating
    slightly, but what seemed like a stream to you where it only
    comes up to your thighs, is a real problem for a four foot dwarf
    like me. I tried to remember all my river crossing drills from
    college but only recalled that you should face up stream. Clanger,
    and of course our shepherd, assisted me, but I still managed
    to get my knickers wet and much more besides, but I'm not saying
    what. I think Fluffy followed me across the river, but I'm afraid
    I didn't stop to watch because I was cold and icicles had started
    to form on various parts of my body.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Ten
    minutes later I was back at the cars. Sub and Dirty Glass fell
    over themselves trying to tell me that they'd got back first,
    outsmarting Rover in the process and almost catching the hares
    too. Sub was a bit sore that Dirty Glass had stayed with him
    for the race to the finish. Who said this wasn't competitive
    and everyone doesn't run on their ego?!!!!</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">At the
    first on down, which was the Walkhampton Inn, we only had time
    to smell the beer before we were shepherded out; not by Snakehips
    but by HT2. Unluckily, Stannary Hash had got there first, causing
    such a riot that the landlord wouldn't allow us to stop. Off
    we went to our second inn, The Rock at Yelverton.</FONT><BR 
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It
    seems that HT2 and Endo had raided a paper mill to produce that
    night's hash mag.........it was enormous! A whole page was allocated
    to the Duck alone! The mag was packed with info concerning Drake's
    555th run weekend. If you haven't yet heard, you are either deaf
    or stupid!! So get a life!! It was nice to see Toxic Vinegar
    making her appearance, hopefully she'll be joining us now it's
    getting lighter. We also had a visitor from another hash called
    Steve, hopefully we didn't put him off too much, so he'll come
    again. I'm afraid the Ovaltinies lived up to their names again,
    as we parted early - not even stopping for hash grub! .........And
    here the hash mag has to end, until next time.........ON ON!</FONT><BR
