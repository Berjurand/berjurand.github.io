    - Annual General Meeting. Sometimes described as an excuse for
    a booze up. It is also when the new committee is elected. With
    Drake H3 being a dictatorship, the old committee decide who the
    new committee should be. For instance, in the year 2000 the old
    committee decided they should also be the new committee and so
    they continued for another year. Hash Awards are normally given
    out for acts above and beyond the call of duty for services to
    muck-ups, confusion and chaos.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"></FONT><FONT

    if someone has found the trail. The normal response is &quot;On
    one, On two&quot; etc depending on the number of piles of sawdust
    the hound has found. However, if you ask a front runner the silence
    is often deafening. It's the only time they're quiet!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR

    off somewhere to the left or right of the one you are on. You
    therefore need to turn around and go back the way you came. The
    correct trail can have turned off anywhere between the back check
    and the last check point. For hares the use of back checks is
    a good way of catching out the front runners and is a most satisfying
    way of getting your own back.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"></FONT><FONT
