     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">What a fantastic run with a turn out
    of one hundred and eighteen runners - one hundred and one being
    new members! I assume this truly euphoric occasion was brought
    about by the success of the Plymouth Marathon (which we organised)
    and the publicity that went with it. The excitement of so many
    new runners not knowing what to expect was electrifying.</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;On,
    On&quot;, was called and off we went in a westerly direction
    with the front runners at the<BR>
    rear, across Roborough Down and into the Walkham Valley meeting
    the River Walkham three hundred yards north of Grenofen Bridge.
    By this time the front runners were up with the main pack. After
    a check we found the trail across the river going east towards
    Bedford Bridge, under the Tavistock Road and on up the Walkham
    out to Stampford Spiney. The pack was still well grouped, which
    was a tremendous credit to the hares, as old vets from Tamar
    Valley H3 know controlling a pack of this size is not easy. <BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">We broke out onto the moors with
    El Pee leading the pack. The trail was lost for some time at
    this point but D.I.A.T. found it again in the old clay pits just
    north of Cadover Bridge (he had come up the Plym). Once again,
    &quot;On, On,&quot; westwards with the pack still tightly packed
    (I always wondered where 'pack' came from) and the pace gathering.
    With the pound of paw and toot of horn - exhilerating beyond
    description - the bucket was soon in sight.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As we
    parked in the ample car park at the Walkhampton Inn, my anticipation
    heightened. Has Diane been to the Barbican for her fresh fish
    that forms a part of the extensive menu at the Walkhampton Inn?
    And, is Ray's Best Bitter up to its normal standard (relish the
    thought!)? &quot;Welcome, people, welcome!&quot; greeted Ray
    as we approached the bar. &quot;A pint of the usual H.T.?&quot;
    I nodded my approval, &quot;the first round is on me!&quot;</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Soon
    the scramble for ale subsided, and the Hash members in true Hash
    style mixed and mingled and introduced themselves to the new
    members - even though most of<BR>
    them weren't female!</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Where's Hubcaps
    ?&quot; I asked Hot Lips. &quot;Gobbling up Marines in Turkey,&quot;
    she replied. (Weren't they ANZAC's ?). Must be like Camp Alegro
    in Curaco, I thought (Ask a Royal Marine!).<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Jane, I sympathise with you. I slept alone for
    3 days once, and I know how tough it is.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">No party at Hot Lips basher on Saturday, June
    20th - Charlie's away. Who the hell is Charlie ? Well, I bet
    you're wondering who the lucky bastard was!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The pressure of work and a long weekend are forcing
    a swift close. If you want to know how the rest of the evening
    went, just look around you!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Royal Corinthian Yacht Club 7.30 p.m. on Friday,

    shoes and hand bags, please.</FONT></P>
