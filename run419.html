     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Parking on the Woolwell roundabout exit
    which leads to nowhere was F.Ferret's equivalent to a mosque's
    staircase. An appropriate place to start a hash with a subtle
    Middle Eastern flavour on the day that Terry Waite was finally
    released.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">It was On On round fields and over banks until
    we arrived in downtown Beruit (or was it a building site). The
    sawdust took us over footings and earthmounds, then there was
    a tour of every mini park and green patch in Woolwell until we
    entered the &quot;West Bank&quot; of Plym Forest. It was rough,
    steep and wet. Channel Tunnel was discretely asked to<BR>
    maintain a respectful silence and lengthen his stride, whilst
    others were called SCBs and told to get out of the way of the
    &quot;these shorts keep your equipment warm&quot; fast runners.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">At the first check flashes of light revealed
    that many hashers were sprouting their winter coats. Whilst Heinz,
    Schweppes, Zippy and Nureyev do not feel the cold (no sense no
    feeling), Sarah had donned a hat and Cat-Man-Do had fitted an
    extension to her shorts.<BR>
    Wimpers and Yakidah had gone the whole hog and had their legs
    customised (or so it seemed).</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">With HT2 blowing her
    Quacker, the hash proceeded at great pace along forest tracks
    and up the steepest, slopes. HT2 was heard to say &quot;Get your
    shorts up there and pull me up&quot;; Not Norman obliged, but
    perhaps not in the intended way. He didn't run as fast from there
    on, but HT2 gleefully tooting her Quacker had a real bounce in
    her stride.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Nureyev kept accelerating past the scribe making
    engine noises and this prompted Deadly to do his Orville Wright
    impersonation. The take off was perfect, the flight was impressive,
    but the landing lacked finesse. Mud and blood splattered in all
    directions. Tony Hancock will never die whilst Deadly bleedsl<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">At the next check the hare announced that he
    had never yet lost a hasher. (It can't be for the lack of trying!)
    Over a viaduct and down to the banks of the river for the wettest
    part of the hash. Only the plaintive toot of HT2's Quacker high
    above gave any<BR>
    indication that IAT was leading her astray. </FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">F.Feret's
    affinity for Foxtor Mires is well known. Clearly he was experiencing
    withdrawal symptoms and this caused us to be led into the deepest,
    stickiest, smelliest bog south of Princetown. Only the Three
    Wise Hashers managed to avoid it; Do Cream Soda, Wimpers and
    Deadly remember every track in West Devon?</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">All that now remained was the ascent
    to Woolwell with ample opportunity to give more blood for this
    hash and observe that Endosperm's goat glands are in full working
    order once again.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Back at the cars again,
    Limpalong gasped that he couldn't run because he couldn't breathe.
    If I had run as fast as him I couldn't breathe ever again! Hashers
    gradually emerged from all directions except for IAT &amp; HT.
    Bart announced that Terry Waite had not been released but merely
    swapped for IAT. With rejoicing for Terry Waite and some sympathy
    for Hezbollah, we set off to the pub, only to find that IAT was
    alive and well and had been hashing in Plymbridge Forest.</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Strange
    creatures come out on dark winter nights, and, sure enough, there
    was Mimi in the pub complete with designer stubble. Relief was
    expressed that he had not cut off his ear and started painting
    sunflowers (yet!), but apparently he did have a few prints of
    naked landrovers.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Mrs Rover got so fed
    up with being telephoned by her husband each Monday evening at
    9.00pm that she produced a fine baby boy! Congratulations! Next
    spring perhaps he can come hashing with the sprog in a backpack,
    which, hopefully, might slow him down.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It only
    remains to say that Slo-Jo, Squeaker &amp; Lotus Blossom were
    their usual serene selves, for you all to have got a mention!</FONT></P>
