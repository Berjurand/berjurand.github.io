     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It was a grey evening, which was unremarkable,
    but for some it would even be unforgettable. Approximately seventeen
    Hashers and three Hashettes assembled in prime S.H.I.T. country
    at the Modbury Health Centre Car Park. I blinked and adjusted
    my gaze, not knowing it would be the last time all of the hash
    would be seen together. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">The Hare's
    shout brought me back to reality and off we went, down Back Street
    to the top of the town, and to the first check. As I don't normally
    see the majority of the Hash but follow the scent, and as we
    were in Hunting Country, I <I>think </I>we lost the Dirty Dozen
    here. Up Brownston Street the remaining Hashers and Hares went,
    through Traine Estate, up Galpin Street (or was it down?), where
    various house viewings took place.<BR>
    El Pee and I pondered, briefly, whether to call in and see the
    Proper and Improper<BR>
    Doctor for a quick drink, but as the run was becoming like 'Ten
    Green Bottles' - it would have meant leaving &quot;two green
    hares hanging (around) by the wall&quot;, so loyalty overcame
    us and we continued around by Swanbridge Mill. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">A new Hasher, Martin, a friend and business associate
    of the Proper Doctor, but with better qualifications, was still
    with us, and was receiving the benefit of various instructions
    and pointers. Wanting to make him 'feel at home' we examined
    various 'blobbed' cow pats as we daintily tripped amongst them,
    pondering on their nitrate content. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">The
    essential mud, stream &amp; bramble part of the run began to
    emerge, as was the answer to the question of why one of the Hares
    had been covered with mud at the beginning of the run. El Pee
    and I were guided to the sluice gate, preferring it to pure slurry,
    and followed the On On's up a ghastly lane which even a Chieftain
    Tank would have been pushed to overcome, and believe me, any
    lane where a Chieftain Tank has to be pushed is not the sort
    of place one would choose for a pleasant stroll. Over a corrugated
    iron gate we went and then into a field with a one in one gradient,
    where the Hare took fleet of foot Snakehips and the other runners
    off to Little Modbury and Lower Little Modbury. It was here that
    I saw a couple of torches and heard a feeble &quot;On On&quot;,
    which couldn't have been Deadly, which heralded the Return of
    the Dirty Dozen.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">El Pee and I shortcutted back past Swanbridge
    Mill while the rest went to Cuttlass<BR>
    Farm, Ayleston Brook, down Runaway Lane, so named after the Battle
    of Modbury in<BR>
    1643 between the Cavaliers and the Roundheads. When the Cavaliers
    lost, they belted off down Runaway Lane - I had visions of a
    re-enactment between Deadly and the Hares, then past the Church
    and down to the Health Centre, where, I believe, you can see
    several wounded Cavaliers still waiting for an appointment. <BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Meanwhile, back in the 'Ex' as resident
    SHITS call the Exeter Inn, the familiar figures of I'm Not Norman
    and Deerhunter were to be seen deeply engrossed in booze and
    gossip.And what was it they were discussing? A sex scandal? A
    smoke ring in the loos?. The 'Getting with Child' of the missing
    Hashette? Maybe even compiling a handbook of runs to go barmy
    on? I have been warned against the damages of speculation and
    can only speak from first hand experience. They were in fact
    offering themselves as prizes in the Modbury Christmas Draw.
    The tickets are free - well, with prizes like that, they would
    have to be! Please apply in writing to the 'Ex'. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">I quickly ordered a chipless supper and sat back
    to enjoy a quiet drink. On glancing out of the window I was amazed
    to see the Farting Armpit or Farmpit as he now seems to be known
    as, pounding down the deserted pavement, reminiscent of the opening
    chapter in 'On the Beach'. His heavy breathing punctuated the
    stillness. He was at this point only seconds away from the car,
    but failed to reappear for about half an hour! Martin followed
    in his footsteps about ten minutes later. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">Eventually, the Hashers but not the Hares, filed
    into the 'Ex' where the usual post mortem on the run took place.
    I understand this to be what orienteers do at even greater length
    after their runs, recalling with macabre detail every second
    of their run. The food looked appetising, until Deerhunter and
    Woodenlegs, sitting opposite Cream Soda, gave an exacting account
    of the untimely demise of a man-eating Tiger adding colour and
    flavour to the rendering by relating it directly to Cream Soda's
    Chilli - minute, blood coloured rice brains and kidney-bean blood
    clots etc. A hardened hasher like Cream Soda is not easily swayed
    from his appetite. Martin added a few references about dehorning
    (calves) although I noticed that he refrained from ordering any
    food himself. All to no avail, so, in desperation, Woodenlegs
    showed Cream Soda her freshly injured, badly gashed, blood splattered
    leg and even that fell on deaf eyes. Only the appearance of the
    Proper Doctor did the trick. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Having
    a medical 'expert' on hand pushed the conversation in the direction
    of a possible theory that hashing safeguarded the nation's mental
    health. Can we collect a small but significant EEC Grant? Would
    Hon Sec look into this, please. Whereupon the Proper Doctor,
    having been cut off from his unbilical telephone, had to return
    home. I, too, was about to leave when I was reminded by Snakehips
    that it was my turn to scribe. SHOCK, HORROR! Did he not know
    that my social calendar was full for this week? Why had I been
    asked to change with Norman when he was there? Crestfallen, I
    then felt obliged to socialise. I found, surprisingly, two very
    pleasant friends of Moby Dick who appeared to have enjoyed their
    run - I hope he keeps them away from an Arkle Run or we will
    never see them again, either! <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">It
    was riveting eavesdropping on Hashers' lustings after Vanessa's
    sexy, silky all-in-one running gear. Please come back soon, Vanessa,
    they get SO unsightly when they dribble...... I have yet to get
    to the &quot;bottom&quot; of the unusual spectacle of Farmpit
    on a rival hash a couple of years ago leaping on top of a table
    during a cabaret and uttering such a masterpiece of a joke that,
    after all this time, no-one can remember - still. Woodenlegs
    reported that she had been overtaken at immense speed during
    the weekend by DIAT, doubtless leaving himself enough time to
    find the Monday hash. A cruel retort of &quot;It's a pity he
    doesn't run as fast as he drives&quot; was wiped from my mind.
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Deadly eventually returned to normal after food
    and drink and the Battle of Modbury 1987. He had just jetted
    in from Jersey where he had spent the weekend as the booze was
    cheaper than at the Chagford pub (Is a Chagford SHIT a CHIT?).
    He had an anxious moment on take-off at Jersey when he read the
    local headlines saying &quot;Pilot Drops Dead Whilst Landing&quot;.
    It was at this point in the evening, when everyone else had gone
    home, and I was desperate to get some 'copy' that a deep meaningful
    discussion on the variations of landing a &quot;FOCKER&quot;
    sans pilot took place between Deadly and Snakehips. A quite staggering
    fact emerged during this conversation. I realised how much Snakehips
    and I were alike. Tall, slim, wonderfully athletic, drooping
    moustache (although I tend to shave mine off), and with the most
    breathtaking knowledge of total trivia and sanctimonious waffle
    this side of the Black Stump! <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Lastly,
    although it's difficult to have a lastly without having a firstly,
    may I present a Chalice of Excellence to whoever started the
    rumour that, after sitting opposite Cream Soda at the Hash Dinner,
    Horsetrough feels we are all a load of boring old farts and has
    resigned his commission. I can recommend a punchbag for his alternative
    Monday evening's entertainment. Hashettes prayers have been answered!!<BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">PS Snakehips, you were right - I should have
    nicked the TVH3 Sturmer mag and just<BR>
    changed the names...........</FONT></P>
