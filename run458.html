    South Hams Amble</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">On
    a golden summer's evening the hash met at the Forescue Arms,
    East Allington for a South Hams pastoral extravaganza. Deadly
    was absent again (it seems that the Chagford senior citizens
    tea dance and bingo night has been moved to Mondays). <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">Katmandu made the traditional hare's speech, warning
    against climbing fences. Of course, some hashers never climb
    a fence - the ones that carry wire cutters. Katmandu also mentioned
    that Bart was still out on the trail. For some reason this conjured
    up visions of a pioneer lost in the Arizona desert with buzzards
    circling overhead, which was possibly not too far from the truth.
    IAT somehow managed to find the start, which only goes to show
    the power of prayer. It appears that he and the monster in 'Alien'
    have quite a lot in common, for instance, when either one shows
    up everyone else disappears, the other similarities are too obvious
    to mention.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The on was called up along a track and
    into the first of many fields:<BR>
    Q. What is the difference between Drake Hash and the England
    cricket team?<BR>
    A. Drake hash is better in the field (But this is no recommendation).</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The
    trail was laid insuch a way as to pass as many gateways as possible,
    meaning unauthorised shortcutting was well and truly punished.
    After climbing a stile, the runners were confronted by an arrow
    artistically laid out on the ground in small stones. It must
    have been a stone age arrowhead. At one point the hash found
    themselves running through stubble, but personally I find a Remington
    Microscreen shaver is less painful. Upon seeing the brightly
    clad hashers in this rural setting, an onlooker would inevitably
    be reminded of a band of rampaging Worzel Gummidges and Aunt
    Sallys. Could this be the reason why the farmers gave the permision
    for the run? Where else could you get moble bird scarers at no
    cost?</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As this was the South Hams of Devon the
    evening would not have been complete without some close encounters
    of the farm animal kind. First there was the opportunity to make
    the acquaintance of a herd of pedigree sheep. As you may expect,
    these were nothing like the wild eyed New Age Traveller type
    of sheep you get on Dartmoor, but were more the respectable retired
    stockbroker-golf club type of sheep - the sort one often encounters
    in the South Hams. Whatever the case, they were still bloody
    stupid!<BR>
    Next came a couple of donkeys behaving most strangely. It seems
    that donkey rides are not only confined to the seaside.</FONT>
    <FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">After the Long /
    Short split the hash regrouped in a field occupied by monochrome
    cattle. There followed a reenactment of Pamplona's 'Running Of
    The Bulls' as the animals stampeded across the field as if their
    lives were at stake (steak?), whilst scattering hashers in all
    directions. </FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The trail took us down to the valley
    bottom where there was a small stream, which was crossed several
    times. However, lurking nearby was a fearsome predator - the
    dreaded maneating Shiggy. An unsuspecting Ferret was running
    along minding his own business (that makes a change!), when the
    Shiggy struck. First one shoe was sucked into the Shiggy's gaping
    maw, then when Ferret tried to rescue it the other shoe disappeared.
    It looked as if the Ferret himself would be next to sink without
    trace, but suddenly there was an awful squelching / puking noise
    and out he came. It seems that even a digusting slimy bog can't
    stomach the Ferret for long! Rover had been quick to offer assistance,whilst
    backing away as discretely as possible.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The
    final obstacle of the evening was a huge hill, but if you that
    it was big you should have seen the mole that made it! After
    we had reached the summit, the bird haunted eaves of The Fortescue
    Arms soon came into view - a very welcome sight. It had been
    a very good run in a completely different area for Drake H3.</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As
    we made our way into the pub, Slo-Jo took the opportunity to
    introduce her new puppy, which she described as &quot;A little
    monster&quot;. The little dog gave us his best &quot;Aren't I
    cute and cuddly?&quot; look, like butter wouldn't melt in his
    mouth, and unlike Slo-Jo's arm which bears the little monster's
    teeth marks (or had Wimpers bitten off more than he could chew?).</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It
    looks as if hashing is going the way of the Olympics with over-comercialisation
    prevalent: The hashers entering the pub had to run the gauntlet
    of Zippy's shoe salesman routine. Following this, they were pounced
    upon by Muscles who was trying to convince all and sundry that
    the latest indispensible fashion item was a Drake H3 tee shirt,
    and at a very reasonable price too. If this was not bad enough,
    when Limpalong asked if anyone could let him have last week's
    hash mag, Cream Soda offered to sell him a copy! Perhaps Bill
    should spell his christian name with a small 'b' in future -
    come to think of it, he always does anyway.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Bart
    explained the problems he had experienced when laying the trail.
    Apparently, it had been eaten by cows, covered by hay and ploughed
    up earlier in the afternoon. He reckoned that two thirds of it
    needed re-laying at 3.00pm. This led him to suspect that there
    was some sort of conspiracy against him - it's a pity he didn't
    suspect the Spanish Inquisition, no-one suspects the Spanish
    Inquisition (or expects them either).</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The big news was that
    Dumbo and Rudolph are now the the proud parents of a bouncing
    baby boy (does this mean he's a spring baby?), so congratulations
    are in order. Begorrah was particularly pleased as he was worried
    that Dumbo might have been inconsiderate enough to be in labour
    when she was due to lay a hash. It seems that John had studied
    with your scribe's family - they both shared the same copy of
    'How To Impersonate A Doctor And Get Away With It'. In view of
    his unconventional footwear it looks as if his hash name should
    be 'Hobnails'. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Sadly the hash
    will be losing Yokelbonker next year (unlike IAT who we lose
    every year), as he will be moving to the Portsmouth area. He
    hopes to start a new hash (The Nelson Hash?). Ducky and Hotfingers
    will be nearby to provide help or, more likely, hindrance. Maybe
    there could be exchange visits between Drake and Nelson.</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Endosperm's
    ethusiasm for hashing knows no bounds: He descended on a couple
    of strangers out for a quiet drink and gave them a browbeating
    until they promised to go hashing every week. At the same time
    he got them to agree to sign up for a time share in Majorca,
    double glazed windows and a new fitted kitchen. HT2 was looking
    at an entry for the 'Race The Train' run in Wales, where runners
    compete against a train over a fourteen mile course. She thought
    that she could walk and still beat the train, then it was explained
    that the train was a steam engine not a British Rail express.</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Slo-Jo
    had previously asked Limpalong what the 'B.S.B.' initials on
    Ross's tee shirt meant. Limpalong sagely replied that they stood
    for 'British Satellite Broadcasting'. He was only slightly wrong,
    as it stands for 'Bandar Seri Begawan' H3 - a Brunei Hash. However,
    the satellite connection is still valid, so how about 'Dishy'
    (or even Squariel) for Ross's hash name? Ross explained that
    hash laying in Brunei is no picnic - in fact it's more like a
    full five course dinner. The hares had to go out every day for
    four or five days in a row to hack a trail through the undergrowth.
    Each runner had to keep calling so that the person following
    did not get lost. When someone did get lost they could be out
    all night in the jungle. Snakes were not a problem but insects
    certainly were. It sounds remarkably like running at Norsworthy
    Bridge in the summer.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The landlord of the pub
    was living dangerously by referring to your scribe's lack of
    craniel follicles. This was a big mistake, because unbeknown
    to him, I am the food and drink correspondent of 'The Woodlouse
    Breeders Gazette', and there will be some pretty telling comments
    about The Fortescue Arms in my next column. Never underestimate
    the power of the press - it's useful for getting the creases
    out of your trousers!</FONT></P>
