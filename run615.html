    been a long time since I last ran with Drake - but as he died
    in 1596 that's really not too surprising. It is unlikely that
    I would have been at this week's hash had it not been for a surprise
    phone call from Dishy &amp; Mole to tell me how much I'd been
    missed, what a marvellous, warm, generous, considerate, caring
    person I was, how they'd love to see me again and how about us
    all going out for a walk together on Sunday? And so it was that
    I found myself on the moor being dragged uphill and down dale,
    over streams and through bogs with two hundredweight of sawdust
    strapped to my back. After all that I was bloody-well sure I
    was going to do the trail on Monday!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">On
    arriving at Eastontown I was reminded that the traditional hash
    greeting takes the form of insults followed by an exchange of
    excuses. From this I learnt that; Begorrah. shouldn't be running
    due to a gammy leg, IAT shouldn't be running due to a gammy leg,
    Deadly shouldn't be running due to a gammy leg. In fact, Deadly
    wasn't running at all. It seems that age has finally caught up
    with The Old Queen, and, being unable to obtain a motorised Zimmer-frame,
    he somehow had got hold of a prototype of the new generation
    of electric wheelchairs. This marvellous invention is so streamlined
    it resembles a mountain bike. Deadly even tried to convince us
    it was a mountain bike, but no-one was fooled by that story -
    not with him having the battery strapped to his head. Yakkidah
    strolled up to me and we exchanged greetings, and so I found
    out that she shouldn't be running because of (and here I was
    expecting ' THE GAMMY LEG' to raise its ugly head again) chicken
    and potato. Oh well, she is Oirish!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">The
    on was called up onto the hillside and in and out of the bracken.
    Axel, a visitor from Austria, had helped to lay the trail. He
    was so proud of his handiwork that he insisted on the runners
    locating every blob of sawdust. Apparently he was very impressed
    with the compact scale of the Dartmoor terrain which is so different
    from the Austrian Alps. It is a little known fact that until
    1990 Dartmoor was higher than the Alps, but then its height had
    to be reduced in order to comply with an European Community directive
    designed to reduce the European Mountain mountain.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">I greeted Snakehips and discovered that he shouldn't
    be running as he had already been out for a two hour run earlier
    in the day and was now feeling knackered. He certainly inspired
    sympathy as he hurdled gorse bushes, leapt streams and sprinted
    up hills. You could say that he had exhaustion written all over
    him, but at the speed he was travelling it was hard to tell what
    was written on his tee-shirt.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">The
    sawdust led us near to Pew Tor, Heckwood Tor and Vixen Tor. Dishy
    &amp; Mole had set the run in such a way so that there were no
    check-backs but the correct trail was difficult to find and required
    a good deal of searching. This had the desired effect of keeping
    the hash together, apart from FFerret, but everyone knew he was
    over the hill (and has been for years). Perhaps he should be
    renamed 'The Lone Ranger' as he always seems to be disappearing
    into the sunset - either that or I had a fly stuck to my spectacles.<BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">I greeted Sub and was informed that
    he shouldn't be running as he had been feeling extremely tired
    of late. He now runs with a heart monitor strapped to his chest.
    This is a useful piece of equipment which lets you know whether
    or not your heart is beating. It has only recently been available
    to the general public but during this short time it has cleared
    up much of the confusion which used to occur whereby living people
    would think that they were dead and vice versa.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">On several occasions a dog was spotted which was
    a dog that was spotted, and the spotted dog was a dalmatian.
    Unfortunately, this dog had a disagreement with Whimpers Algie
    because spotted dogs make him go dotty.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">After
    Vixen Tor there was a long/short split which ensured that the
    hash was together at the base of Barn Hill. From here the trail
    took us to Moortown and Pew Tor rocks. Five minutes from the
    end of the hash we were joined by Rover who had arrived late
    and<BR>
    had set off on his own to find the sawdust. He had spent most
    of his time running towards a group of people on the horizon,
    only to discover that they were moving far too quickly for the
    hash. It was only then that he realised that he had been following
    a group of walkers. After much effort Rover eventually caught
    up with us at the final long/short split which gave everyone
    a good downhill ran back to the cars. The trail had succeeded
    very well and what with the perfect weather conditions made for
    a very enjoyable run. Well done Dishy, Mole &amp; Axel!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">The on down was at the Walkhampton Inn where the
    landlady is an ex-hasher. Perhaps this is just as well, because
    when the hares arrived at the pub on Sunday evening after laying
    the trail ,they began a detailed conversation about sheep ticks.
    As it is never enough to just talk about sheep ticks, they started
    examining themselves for signs of the pesky insects. This earned
    them some very funny looks from the other customers and quickly
    ensured that they had the end of the bar to themselves. Despite
    all of this we were given a warm welcome on Monday with not an
    insect spray in sight.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">As I greeted
    Tirikerbell in the bar, she told me that she shouldn't be running
    as she is concentrating on training for the world mountain bike
    championships at Newnham Park, near Plymouth. It seems she has
    got a novel approach to this competition; as she doesn't want
    all this training to go to waste she has written to the race
    organisers asking them to send out her results before the race,
    then she can decide whether it is worth entering the competition.<BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">The Beast's editorial skills were
    much in evidence in the hash mag he had provided for our cultural
    stimulation. His policy was to omit the boring extraneous details
    that so often get in the way of a good story. Consequently, the
    'next week's run location' part of the mag was ditched to make
    way for an in depth expose of what Granny Hill did (or didn't
    do) on her holidays in Devon. Unfortunately, the choice of subject
    matter was not universally popular, as it was pointed out that
    it is bad enough when Deadly is in the hash mag, without having
    to read about other old women as well.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Not
    Norman and FFerret could be seen engaged in furtive conversation
    in a quiet corner. The topic of their discussion was wild oats
    and how to sow them. There was a good deal of speculation about
    when Ferret last did any planting, but it's in all the history
    books that the date of the the last Norman conquest was 1066.<BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Sitting together at the other side
    of the room were Martin and Twice-A-Week. I hadn't met either
    of them before but they seemed very pleasant, so it is a bit
    of a mystery why they are with Drake. They seem to have got friendly
    very quickly - they were overheard making arrangements to do
    some canoedling over the weekend. This isn't the sort of thing
    that normally happens at Drake, but then Twice-A-Week used to
    run with Tamar Valley H3, so allowances have to be made for her.
    It was decided, that Martin should be given the hash name 'Woodentop'
    because of his spotty dog (The Woodentops were a BBC childrens'
    TV programme back in the early days of television, in which a
    spotty dog featured strongly. I know all this because an old
    lady told me. Thanks Dishy!).<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">It
    was good to see Whimpers, who is on holiday, enjoying his evening
    with the hash. He has to make the most of his runs with Drake
    for he is unable to hash in London. He spoke about how much he
    misses Devon and how he is hoping to return here as soon as possible.
    As our conversation progressed, Whimpers waxed lyrical about
    the dramatic beauty of the coast, the grandure of the moors,
    and the warmth and humour of the simple Devon folk. As he was
    speaking a far away look came into his eyes, and when I turned
    to go he grasped my arm, and in a voice choked with emotion,
    asked if he could tell me something he had not told anyone before.
    I nodded. &quot;Well&quot; he said, the words being wrenched
    from the very depths of his being, &quot;I shouldn't be running,
    I've got a gammy leg!&quot;.<BR CLEAR="ALL"></FONT></P>
