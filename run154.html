     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Sixteen 'enterprising' hashers gathered
    for what was generally assumed to be a drier run than the previous
    week. They included two visitors - Sharky Junior (to be known
    as Jaws 2!) and Tom (Plus Four), who, after being introduced
    to Farting Ferret, was immediately acknowledged as a fellow civil
    servant. Do they have a secret handshake, or was it because he
    checked out each trail in triplicate? The Ferret was observed
    carrying around a paper bag which according to The Highwayman
    contained his supper, but which Ferret claimed was batteries
    for his torch. Apparently, he wanted to extract the last ounce
    of juice from the old ones before throwing them away. Why doesn't
    he do like IAT and get a Black &amp; Decker which is timed to
    run out ten minutes before the end of a run?<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">Cream Soda turned up in his winter gear - long johns,
    balaclava etc. What is he going to do when it gets cold?!! He
    was also sporting a new line in torches, a sort of 'Push Me-Pull
    You' version, which gives off beams from both ends, so you can't
    tell whether he is coming or going. No doubt, it is also designed
    to cope with Arkle double runs!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">As
    to where the run went, your guess is as good as mine. The hare
    appeared from time to time to put us on to sawdust, and to shortcut
    the ladies, who, as usual, were nattering about inconsequential
    matters. Hubcaps was running on all sixteen valves and showing
    her behind to us ordinary eight valve jobs, whilst George was
    being taken for walkies (or rather runnies) by Sam. At various
    stages El Pee and Dogcatcher disappeared. However, I have it
    on good authority that Dogcatcher was observed knocking up somebody.
    We're not sure whose door it was, but Hotlips lives in the general
    area! As my B &amp; D torch, which I last saw in her downstairs
    loo, is now apparently in the back of Not Norman's car, one does
    wonder what sort of company she is keeping!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">In the absence of Horsetrough, The Highwayman was
    making valiant attempts to blow the horn, but from where I was
    the wind seemed to be blowing from the wrong end! The Deadly
    Old Queen was prancing around the streets getting all the checks
    wrong, but what can you expect from only the fifth best daytime
    orienteer? On the other hand, according to Hubcaps, Wimpers is
    the British Night Champion - he's also pretty good at orienteering!<BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">At the on down (town) the hash split
    into its usual select groups (well, some of them are), making
    it difficult to obtain any worthwhile scribing material. Since
    the Improper Doctor gave up hashing, the quality - and quantity
    - of scribing has been severely reduced. On the way home El Pee
    attempted to Lope(s) off to see Nicole (on business, he said),
    but when deterred, he made for the Royal Oak to see another Nicholl.
    Like a sailor with a girl in every port, El Pee has one in every
    pub!</FONT></P>
