    OFFER YOU A FREE TRIP TO THE EXOTIC FAR EAST FOR AN AWAY HASH!
    SEE BELOW FOR DETAILS!</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You were quite FREE to
    take a TRIP to Deadly's run at Steps Bridge if you felt like
    it. It was in the Teign valley, near Dunsford and you can't get
    more EXOTIC than that, being at the FAR EAST of Drake's range,
    well AWAY from the usual area for a HASH! NB. It is possible
    that some readers may have taken the above hash flash to mean
    that Drake H3 was offering a free flight to Asia, and are now
    feeling rather let down. If you were one of those persons. .........TOUGH!,
    it serves you right for being such a DIMBO. You obviously have
    all the intelligence of a particularly stupid nematode worm,
    and deserve all the disappointments you get!<BR>
    <U><BR CLEAR="ALL"></U><BR>
    At Steps Bridge car park at the start of January, it's the little
    things that help to brighten up a dark winter's night - like
    Tinkerbell for instance. She was wearing running tights that
    made her legs look like two barbers' poles. Perhaps she has taken
    up mobile hairdressing, or did she think that it was going to
    be a polar expedition?<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Deadly was showing off his new car which plays
    a little tune, just like an ice cream van. Sadly, we were not
    able to hear 'The Woody Woodpecker's song in all its glory, as
    the mechanism had stuck on two notes. This was apparently because
    the large key on top of the car needed winding.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">It was good to see Cream Soda who had not been
    hashing recently, because of a reoccurrence of the disease which
    leaves him feeling drained, aching and sore. He had been struck
    down again by the dreaded orienteering bug: '0rienteering - the
    sport that's as much fun as a dose of flu'.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">After casting an eye over the assembled hashers
    (then catching and returning it to its socket), it seemed that
    Drake H3 had been joined by two new young ladies. They appeared
    to have some sort of connection with Deadly, but what could it
    be? Guesses included; nurses, in case the old chap required urgent
    medical attention, e.g. when he goes uphill; new wives in the
    event of him being a mormon (moron?); long lost great granddaughters;
    young 'friends' with whom he has a perfectly proper and above
    board relationship - but don't tell his wife, she wouldn't understand.
    In fact, it turned out that one of the young ladies had the misfortune
    to work with Deadly as his secretary. He said that he'd been
    trying to get her to come for weeks, and now she had come at
    last. Unfortunately, she went much quicker, because within ten
    minutes of the start of the run she and her friend had got separated
    from the rest of the hash, and so they returned to their car
    and went home. They were not very happy with the Old Queen for
    neglecting them, and so it looks as if the only laptop he'll
    be getting from now on will be a computer!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Of the run itself only vague impressions remain;
    trees, mud and hills. The hare has informed me that the trail
    went around Bridford and St Thomas Cleave woods. At one stage
    it occurred to your scribe's fevered imagination that we could
    be running up and down the back of a giant hedgehog, and what
    we thought were trees were really<B> </B>spines. This would make
    the hash the equivalent of fleas (very appropriate), so what
    would happen if it decided to have a scratch? Would the headlines
    read 'HASH HOUSE<BR>
    HARRIERS IN HUGE HEDGEHOG HORROR'? Graphic proof of how hills
    and lack of oxygen can affect the brain.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Mudflaps insisted that Limpalong overtake on
    her right, which just happened be on the side of a precipice
    - she said that she'd get her own back for the free 'mudpack'
    he had given her on the previous week's run. HT2 was going to
    try to overtake too, but was unsure of her footing. A lack of
    grip could have caused her shoes to do a wheelspin, so sending
    her over the cliff. She also knew how much Mudflaps enjoys a
    good wheelspin and didn't want to get her overexcited.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">FFerret was seen intensely staring at the ground
    whilst running along. He said that he was hoping to find sawdust,
    which was odd, because he'd been on it for the best part of a
    mile. This can only mean that his shortcutting has now got so
    bad that he's finally forgotten what sawdust looks like.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Endosperm managed to get lost and found at the
    same time - he lost his sense of direction and found he didn't
    know where he was. And so there in the wilderness he fell to
    his knees (it was very slippery), and prayed for guidance. And
    lo, there appeared a sign from above (which read 'Steps Bridge
    1 mile'), and following the path of righteousness he finally
    saw the divine light... of his car. And great was the rejoicing
    at his return - HT2 wanted to get to the pub!</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     FACE="Arial"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"></FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The general opinion of the hash was that
    it was a very good trail which worked well. Despite this it unfortunately
    failed to live up to the standard set by Deadly's other runs
    in the same area i.e. no-one was permanently lost or had to be
    taken to hospital.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The on down was at the White Hart Hotel at Moretonhampstead.
    The local press recently reported that Moretonhampstead was employing
    a private security fim to guard against crime in the town. I
    cannot say that it is very effective, because as was walking
    to the pub a man jumped out of the shadows and viciously twisted
    my arm. It's amazing how people can do things like this and still
    remain Anonymouse. I had to give him what he asked for - so that
    is why you have to suffer my scribing this week.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">It came as rather a suprise to see some of the
    rougher members of the hash in the rather grand 'Eating Room',
    and they weren't even standing on the tables, throwing food or
    fighting either! Undoubtedly, this was because Wild Bill, with
    the air of a keeper at a chimp's teaparty, was on hand to keep
    them in order. Things were going well until a waitress appeared
    with some food and asked for Aaron. At this FFerret's thin veneer
    of civilisation cracked; &quot;Go into the next bar and shout
    GOBSHITE&quot; he told her. And so it was not long before Drake
    found themselves back in the public bar. Ferret also informed
    ua that Zippy could not make it to the hash, as he was poorly
    - but poorly what? Poorly dressed?, poorly equipped?, poorly
    paid? WE DEMAND TO KNOW!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Tinkerbell was making sure that everyone knew
    that Sub has become a Navel Officer. So if his navel is now an
    officer, what rank is the rest of him? Will he be known as Sub-Lieutenant
    Bellybutton from now on?<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Snakehips reported that he had seen a deer in
    the woods. Apparently, it was a large animal with red eyes, which
    doesn't sound very much like a deer to me. You would think that
    he knew what Deadly looked like by now!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Rover was very pleased that there were no dogs
    on the hash - it gave him the chance to fetch sticks, beg for
    chips and roll over for his tummy to be tickled. So <I>that's</I>
    how he got his hash name.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Through the hubbub of conversation it sounded
    as if someone was asking how come Whimpers posted two greenfinches.
    Were they sent air mail?, or was this a new version of the pigeon
    post? It turned out that Whimpers has been <I>posted to<B> </B>Greenwich</I>
    and so he will shortly be leaving for some time.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">According to Begorrah the reason Yakkidah says
    everything twice is because she's a Dublin girl (doubling girl).
    This was taking poetic licence a bit far as she is a Belfast
    girl. It was then suggested that it meant that Yakki was beautiful
    (Belle) and fast, but Begorrah laughed at this suggestion and
    said that 'Bel' meant 'bloody' in Gaelic.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Bart was all set to go to Bodmin as he had heard
    there was a wild female there that leaves you with scratches
    down your back. He suddenly lost interest when he found out that
    it was a big cat.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">In the light of recent political scandals Cream
    Soda has held an investigation into the private lives of the
    Drake H3 committee, and as a result of his findings the entire
    committee are to tender their resignations. Their behaviour has
    been totally unacceptable - there has not been a single scandal
    since they took office. Why haven't Whimpers and Deadly been
    caught sharing a sleeping bag at an orienteering event 'to save
    money'? Why are Anonymouse's children all legitimate? Why hasn't
    Dishy used hash funds to buy a council house in the highly desirable
    'Swilly' district of Plymouth? How can we trust people like these
    to run our hash.? Drake members expect a certain standard of
    (mis)behaviour from the committee and the present incumbents
    have badly let us down!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">NOW IS THE TIME TO APPOINT A NEW COMMITTEE AND
    INSTIGATE A BACK TO BASIC CORRUPTION POLICY. IN ORDER TO ENSURE
    THAT DRAKE HASH HOUSE HARRIERS GETS THE COMMITTEE IT DESERVES
    ALL HASHERS MUST ATTEND THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING AT THE PLUME
    OF FEATHERS PUBLIC HOUSE ON MONDAY 31 JANUARY 1994.</FONT></P>
