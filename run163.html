    few brave stalwarts ventured across Dartmoor to Deadly's 'local'
    through the usual thick mist which descends when Deadly lays
    the trail on 'his' side of the Moor. However, at least on this
    occasion we didn't have to run the gauntlet of police road blocks
    which prevailed towards the end of the week when one of Her Majesty's
    guests decided to move out of Princetown.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The run was as usual late starting, with the
    hare claiming to have been waiting for late-comers inside the
    Sandy Park Inn, whilst we were all waiting for the hare outside!!
    Actually, the main reason for the delay was that Endosperm was
    having difficulty balancing himself between a couple of holes
    in his shorts and was worried about a draught getting at him.
    It was an awful lot of fuss about an extremely small problem
    as I<BR>
    understand it!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">It was a most unusual run, because, although
    laid by Deadly, it was to prove almost <BR>
    completely dry - so much so that several of the pack deliberately
    left the trail at one stage just to find a stream to paddle in.
    We even crossed the river Teign twice - USING BRIDGES would you
    believe!!! It would seem that senile decay has finally set in
    for Deadly - it may be necessary to have him put down soon.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Of course, the fact that did not leave on time
    made no difference whatsoever to the length of the run, which
    Deadly claimed to have covered in forty one minutes earlier in
    the day. Consequently, the trail took the average person about
    an hour and a quarter to complete, which meant that it was nearly
    nine o'clock before we returned to the pub - a fact only slightly
    eased by finding out that at least they stayed open until eleven
    o'clock.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The run was so long that IAT gave up quite early
    on and in spite of having eaten a Marathon bar at the half way
    stage he still had to lie down for a rest on no less than two
    occasions. Why he chose such muddy spots for a kip I shall never
    understand, but that's IAT I guess.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Back at the On Down the Landlord and Landlady
    were so pleased to see us (or was it the thought of having some
    extra pocket money for their trip to Kenya?) that they actually
    donated the contents of the bucket to us - Hash Cash please note!!!
    As usual, Deadly had left a map showing what a lovely scenic
    route we had been on and having looked at it I discovered that
    he had actually put out two lots of sawdust - there is a prize
    for anyone who saw them both and can correctly identify their
    locations.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Alan T. who once actually partook in a Hash was
    present at the On Down and has obviously now taken up a less
    physically tasking sport. Apparently, I was supposed to be surprised
    to see him, but who cares? Very little (and this is not intended
    to be a reference to Endo's earlier problem) happened at the
    On Down. Hubcaps and George<BR>
    left at ten - it's time they learned that if you leave early
    you get talked about. As they walked out I was asked if they
    were mother and daughter - but I'm not sure which was which.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">I think this is enough drivel for now so I shall
    turn to something even less interesting, unless you are known
    as Abdul, because Snakehips has found a new squat at Abdul's
    place in Hartley, Plymouth. Isn't it funny how everyone else
    wanted to move in there when Mooney was in residence, but no,
    not Snakehips, he had to wait until there was no opposition for
    Abdul's attentions. Hasn't he heard about AIDS yet!</FONT><BR

    Possibly the bi-annual A.G.M. will be held on Friday 27 February
    1987. It was to have been held at the Two Bridges Hotel, but
    I'm told that &quot;the girls don't want to lay a trail on the
    moor&quot;. Presumably they are afraid of the competition from
    all those sheep!!! It will now probably be held in Plymouth and
    I'm told that the attendance of wives is compulsory, which sounds
    like discrimination against women and single men to me.</FONT></P>
