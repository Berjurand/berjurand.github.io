     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It was wonderful to be
    back in the bosom of Drake. This, of course, is not a lie since
    it was written unintentionally and I did not know that I was
    misleading you at the time and that I was indeed not telling
    the truth. If I had tried consciously not to be totally honest
    I would resign immediately and not have to write this hash mag.
    So that's alright then.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Like the pyramids and the Archers, nothing had
    changed. There was a strong smell of horse embrocation wafting
    about at the car park below Sheeps Tor. Judging by the urgency
    of some of the warming up quite a few hashers had mistakenly
    applied the 'Deep Heat' to the internal surfaces of their athletic
    supports. Not that your average Drake hasher has much to support
    (so I have been reliably informed - source: Skippy).<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">This was the first trail that Deferred Entry
    had laid and I thought he coped with the abuse admirably. Up
    the side of Sheeps Tor, Zippy could be heard ranting about the
    raving homos in front, just because he wasn't (in front - that
    is!). It would seem more logical to worry about them if they
    were at the back. A long loop so confused the combined talent
    on offer, that the poor old hare had to rescue two lost souls
    whilst the rest wandered round bleating and breaking wind till
    the man returned to lead the way down into the forest. Emerging
    from the trees into prairie old Def. Ent. had laid a contrived,
    devious loop down to Nattor Brook and back. Goes to show that
    you can't rely on today's yoof to play with a straight bat and
    treat the old farts contingency with more consideration.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">On the way back around Sheeps Tor it became obvious
    to those who noticed, that the Wilderness Man a.k.a. IAT was
    no longer with us. Has he ever been?, I hear you ask. Upon reaching
    the cars it became clear that Heinz had also been claimed by
    the Sheeps Tor Triangle. A responsible Hash would have set up
    a command post, sent out search parties, contacted the Dartmoor
    Rescue Group and readied a Sea King helicopter on standby. Good
    old Drake all buggered off to the pub. Excuse No.1: Heinz- &quot;Being
    out front, I followed a trail of sawdust which, after a substantial
    distance, I realised was several weeks old and not ours. No wonder
    the bastards couldn't catch me.&quot; Excuse No. 2: IAT - (The
    man has refused to comment since he failed to appear at the pub.
    Skippy found him in his car without trousers or shoes) &quot;I
    can't come in to the pub, I haven't got any trousers or shoes
    on&quot;. Brilliant. Apparently, he followed a flashing light
    but it turned out to be a dog. I know, I know, try asking IAT.
    <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Plenty of the usual smut and
    innuendo flying at the bar. Here is a tiny fraction of it, all
    accurately and truthfully retold:<BR>
    Twice-A-Week (1): &quot;Have a look at my little slit&quot; (sic)<BR>
    Twice-A-Week(2): &quot;I want a fast person for the weekend&quot;<BR>
    Twice-A-Week (3): &quot;I like someone at the front and someone
    at the back&quot;<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Tinkerbell to Yakki: &quot;Who did you get off
    with then?&quot;<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Yakki:&quot;I was very innocent. I was very disgusted&quot;<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Uncle Dave: &quot;I always come on my bike&quot;<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Deadly:&quot;Shagging? Where?!!!&quot;<BR>
