    the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Championships on TV could not prevent
    a large gathering of hashers turning up at Mothecombe for the
    S.H.I.T.S. barbecue run. It was no doubt thanks to the detailed
    instructions given in the hash mag that we all managed to find
    it. It was only because Minder was refusing to obey instructions
    that prevented Mimi from taking one of his usual cross-country
    short cuts and so stopped him ending up who knows where. But
    instead of who knows where, he ended up following F Ferret along
    the conventional route and was in turn closely followed by IAT
    who also did not know the way. Piggy cycled all the way from
    Plymstock and then cycled off again, not realising Deadly had
    returned from holiday. Not Norman, Smutty &amp; Deerhunter turned
    up to pay one of their infrequent visits and were accompanied
    by a couple of Plympton H3 groupies. It was not clear who was
    with whom - maybe it was a menage a cinq!</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Discerning
    hashers will note that this mag is being produced on the new
    standard mag letterhead, which is obtainable from the Chief Scribe
    and which all scribes are encouraged, nay instructed, to use.
    The committee no longer want to see hash mags produced on the
    backs of old shopping lists or on recycled toilet paper. We must
    have uniformity in our hash - there is no room for individuality!
    <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Whilst we're on this subject,
    it has been noticed that some hashers are not wearing the regulation
    blue running shirts or singlets for the hash run, and the purple
    sweatshirts for the apres-hash. The more you wear them the sooner
    they can be washed and the shrunken result given to your wife,
    dog or Abdul. The habit of turning up in any old gear on a Monday
    night should be discouraged (and punished). The Grand Master
    has decreed that Drake hashers must be distinguishable from other
    idiots at large on Monday nights, so in the great tradition of
    History's megalomaniacs, we have had Hitler's Brownshirts, Mussolini's
    Blackshirts and now we've got Mimi's Purpleshirts! It is important
    to note, however, that one never sees Endosperm &amp; HT2 in
    anything but matching ensembles. Last Monday, for instance, they
    were in fetching red outfits, although I noticed their shoes
    did not match, and probably neither did their underwear - but
    I cannot vouch for this as I wasn't in a position to see (El
    Pee got in the way).</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">To get back to the run,
    it started and finished in the car park and in between there
    was a confused mixture of field and woods designed to take us
    down to the estuary by 8.00pm (low tide). Not Norman seemed to
    know exactly where the trail went because of the previous hashes
    he had done in the area, but unfortunately, he did not have the
    courage of his convictions. On reaching the estuary, the main
    pack went through the woods, whilst the mavericks such as the
    Ferret, Not Norman, Deerhunter &amp; IAT elected to continue
    along the estuary shore (each wondering as he looked at his companions
    whether he had done the right thing). On this occasion, they
    had (wonders will never cease!), because the rest of the hash
    emerged from the woods some ten minutes after the frontrunners
    had passed by.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The next obstacle to be overcome was
    the river crossing. Mimi decided to try a bit of water skiing,
    but fell flat on his face, soaking Son-of-IAT in the process.
    On the far side of the river there was a Long / Short split,
    where the geriatrics sauntered gently back in the company of
    Slo-Jo and George (horseless this week), in time to see the long
    runners return in various states of disarray.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The
    barbecue was sparsely attended, which was just as well, as there
    were only two barbecue grills - Not Norman's disposable one and
    a more sophisticated one belonging to Wimpers. Unfortunately,
    the sophisticated version took a long time to get going despite
    having a full bottle of meths poured over it, which sadly left
    Wimpers with nothing to drink. He usually has some lesser ranked
    person to perform these tasks for him, but Slo-Jo was busy shooing
    the public off her beach. Cream Soda &amp; Not Norman seeing
    which way the wind was blowing, proceeded to commandeer Not Norman's
    barbecue causing him to whinge ineffectively between swigging
    beer and guzzling sausages and mince pies.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">El Pee,
    had made his usual late arrival at the start and appeared to
    be wearing a false beard (surely it couldn't have been real),
    but was nowhere to be seen down on the beach. Deadly was also
    missing, because having injured his achilles tendon on the run
    he had rushed off to see Helen (sorry - Elaine). No doubt the
    rest of the hash were sitting in the warmth and comfort of the
    Dartmoor Union Inn, instead of eating gritty sausages on a chilly
    beach!</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">HASH FLASHES:<BR>
    Rudolph is now working for a Japanese company and therefore wishes
    to be known as 'Rudolph-san'.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Cream Soda recently made
    a mystery visit to London, which I believe was for the purpose
    of having a new pacemaker installed for the Albaston Relay. I
    suggest that he asks for his money back!</FONT></P>
