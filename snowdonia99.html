    REPORT: DRAKE HASH HOUSE HARRIERS EXPEDITION<BR>
    TO LLANBERIS, SNOWDONIA, NORTH WALES 10 - 12 SEPTEMBER 1999</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Expedition members:
    Anonymouse, Beast, Dishy, Limpalong, Mole, Mudflaps, Neville,
    No Handle, Plodder.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Expedition members
    started arriving at the Alpine Lodge, Llanberis around 7.30pm
    on Friday evening after overcoming the traffic jams of the west
    Midlands and the inevitable problems with the north Welsh motorways
    i.e. there aren&#146;t any. You can tell what the English think
    of the Welsh from the fact the dual carriageways run out near
    Shrewsbury. However, somebody suggested this might be a Welsh
    plot to keep the English out!</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Upon arriving
    at the Alpine Lodge Hotel Dishy and Neville shocked the proprietor
    by informing him of their intention to use his bunkhouse to sleep
    with five men over the next couple of days. Luckily, they omitted
    to tell him about the two dogs as well, in order to avoid police
    involvement. As a result, Anonymouse &amp; Mudflaps were consigned
    to the luxury of the hotel itself, and so missed out on a &#145;Once
    In A Lifetime&#146; opportunity to share the bunkhouse with No
    Handle's feet.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">That evening
    after a brief visit to a local &#145;hostelry&#146; we headed
    to an offshoot of the local bistro for a meal (and very good
    it was too). Neville asked the waitress what shopping was like
    in Llanberis and was told that if she wanted to do some she&#146;d
    be finished by 10.00am. The waitress kindly added that the shops
    open at 9.30am.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The meal was
    interspersed with mobile phone calls in an attempt to contact
    The Beast and party who had not yet arrived. However, when Limpalong
    did get through to him it turned out that his group had already
    eaten and were already headed for a pub. The Beast promised to
    ring back to let the bistro group know which pub it was, when
    he got there. Unfortunately, Limpalong had given him the wrong
    number, so when he did phone back he got a building site in Cardiff.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">After the meal
    a small contingent headed for The Heights Hotel, Llanberis&#146;s
    equivalent of Stringfellows. The place was certainly busy. So
    busy in fact, that the barman deserted the bar when serving Limpalong,
    and so Mole ended up leaning across the bar to finish pouring
    the pint. Welcome to Britain&#146;s first self service pub.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The weather forecast
    for Saturday had been superb, but sadly no one had bothered to
    let the weather know what was expected of it. Consequently, Saturday
    morning dawned overcast and stormy with strong winds. It looked
    like the sort of day to stay off the hills, so all the Drake
    contingent set off to climb Tryfan (915 metres, 3010 feet). There
    followed an invigorating climb with easy scrambling - easy for
    humans, that is. Because the dogs were finding it hard to get
    up the rocky outcrops, Neville, Plodder, Dishy &amp; Mole split
    from the group and took another route to the top.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The remaining
    group of The Beast, Limpalong, No Handle, Anonymouse and Mudflaps
    got to the summit first and proceeded to eat their lunch, whilst
    waiting for the others to appear. The weather took a turn for
    the worse with fog, and wind driven hail and still the other
    group did not arrive. A search party failed to find them. After
    the best part of an hour the summit party decided to go on. And
    who did they meet just after they left the top? You guessed it,
    Plodder &amp; Co sitting comfortably out of the wind as if they
    were on a picnic. It seems they had got to the summit decided
    there wasn&#146;t a lot to see and come off again! Bastards.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The route off
    Tryfan was not very clear, but The Beast knew the area well so
    finding the path was not a problem. However, quite a few other
    walkers were not finding it so easy and at one point we had at
    least twenty people following us. They wouldn&#146;t have been
    so confident had they known it was No Handle who was in the lead!
    Poles came in very useful on the descent as The Beast found out.
    They take the weight off your knees and are cheaper to employ
    than Lithuanians.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">At a convenient
    point the Tryfan summit group decided to go on to test themselves
    to the limit on Glyder Fach &amp; Glyder Fawr, while Dishy, Mole,
    Neville &amp; Plodder decided to head back and test their credit
    cards to the limit in the local outdoor shops.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">On the way to
    Glyder Fach we met a group of marines from 42 Commando with full
    kit who had been walking over peaks all day, followed by a young
    couple with light packs who advised us to go back as the weather
    was too bad. We listened to their advice, then ignored it. The
    remainder of the walk was very enjoyable, despite the weather.
    The summits of the Glyders were strewn with projecting rock formations
    and were well worth seeing.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As we got back
    to the car we noticed a mountain rescue helicopter repeatedly
    returning to the summit of Tryfan. There was speculation that
    it had been called out by No Handle to rescue the two bread rolls
    he had lost on the mountain, but it turned out it was there to
    rescue one of the marines who had broken his leg on the summit.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The evening&#146;s
    entertainment commenced with a visit to &#145;The Heights&#146;
    just to check that our original impression of the place was correct.
    Limpalong&#146;s birthday was celebrated with due style, after
    all its not everyday that he&#146;s twenty nine.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As the Bistro
    we had used the previous night was closed, we had opted to visit
    the local Indian Restaurant for the evening meal. There followed
    an extremely enjoyable meal, despite the food. Neville managed
    to prevent a fight between two locals, but couldn&#146;t protect
    the waiter from Dishy and No Handle who were not satisfied with
    their food . Finally when the bill arrived we found that we had
    been charged for a meal we had not received, but following representations
    this was put right. It was good job that the waiter didn&#146;t
    notice that we hadn&#146;t been charged for the wine.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The more committed
    members of the party returned to &#145;The Heights&#146; just
    to make sure that our confirmation of our original impression
    was correct. Fuelled by the local brew No Handle was the life
    and soul of the party. His nude version of the &#145;Funky Chicken&#146;
    across the bar room tables had to be seen to be believed. He
    had such a good time (before he passed out and had to be carried
    back to the hotel) that he can&#146;t remember any of it, and
    swears that he wasn&#146;t even there! Try telling that to Megan
    and Sian - they&#146;re expecting..................him to write.
    Back in the bunkhouse the evening was rounded off to the delicate
    strains of Sylvester Stallone machine gunning terrorists in a
    subway. The end of a perfect day.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Sunday morning
    dawned bright and clear (unlike some members of the party), and
    it was obvious the weather was set fair. The objective was Snowdon
    (1085 metres, 3560 feet) which has good paths to the summit,
    and everyone was going on the walk. The trek to the summit was
    enlivened by Mudflaps taking off and putting on clothing every
    couple of hundred metres. I know she likes to be well prepared,
    but how often do you see people taking a suitcase up a mountain?</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">On the shoulder
    of the mountain Plodder and Anonymouse decided that the walk
    needed a little more excitement so they headed off to walk the
    Crib-goch ridge, an airy scramble over a narrow arrete. The remainder
    of the party continued on the track . We stopped near the summit
    and had lunch whilst admiring the superb views. Plodder and Anonymouse
    soon joined us after running the final part of the ridge. They
    enjoy a challenge, so next year they&#146;re coming back to do
    it again, only blindfolded on pogo<BR>
    sticks. Now that&#146;s what I call style!</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The summit of
    Snowden was more crowded than Llanberis, which is not surprising
    as it has more facilities. The Beast took full advantage of the
    cafe and bought himself a beer. He&#146;s completing his own
    version of the Munros by getting drunk on all British mountains
    over 3000 feet. As we stared down from the viewing platform we
    saw the same marines we had seen on Saturday yomping up towards
    us (still in full kit). They stopped next to us for a rest and
    the radio operator nearly took three of us out with his aerial.
    Perhaps it is the military&#146;s latest secret weapon, silent
    and deadly, with the added bonus of picking up &#145;The Archers&#146;
    on a Sunday morning.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The trek back
    to the cars proved quite interesting in places as we left the
    main footpath and scrambled down a scree slope. Mole was in his
    element and led the way. He&#146;s a real mountain man, so much
    so that the Welsh have done him the honour of naming a mountain
    after him: Mole Siabod.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We had all arrived
    back at the Pen y Pass car park by about 2.30pm and then set
    off home. What a great weekend! Thanks very much to The Beast
    for organising the trip, we all thoroughly enjoyed it. Hopefully
    the hash will be doing something similar in the not too distant
    future. If you&#146;ve got the chance try to come along - you
    know it makes sense! <BR>
