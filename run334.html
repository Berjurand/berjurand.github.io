     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I've been asked to scribe this as IAT?
    has metal fatigue - sorry, I understand that is supposed to be
    mental fatigue. Hands up those who can tell the difference. As
    I had tried to sabotage the run completely by giving the wrong
    instructions for the 'next run',<BR>
    with a bit of luck there wouldn't have been any run to write
    about. Not until Monday night will we know how many went to Lanehead
    - and enjoyed themselves.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">I had the doubtful pleasure of being driven to
    the run by IAT?, I can see why Mimi arrives<BR>
    somewhat tense when he does the same thing. Coming out of Moretonhampstead
    I gave quite clear vague instructions about taking a short cut,
    only to be ignored. Only reluctantly did he take the next one.
    He had some deeply seated tribal instinct about having been here
    before and 'knowing where he was'. Incidentally IAT? is going
    to feature large in this mag, so if you want to throw it away,
    now is the time.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Deadly had chosen perhaps the smallest parking
    lot we've had in a long time so it was as well that not too many
    of us turned up. Lorraine thought that perhaps things might have
    improved so gave it another try. I think we'll have to call her
    'Dynamite' as she was sporting a T-shirt with TNT writ large
    upon it. Her husband Fred came along with two pairs of trainers
    (talk about fine tuning). I'm afraid Limpalong was in his Kermit
    shoes again. There was another new chap but in the general disorder
    after the run (caused by you know who), I didn't catch his name.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Strangely, on his own run. Deadly did not insist
    that we left dead on 7.30! The first check occurred where the
    footpath went up to Cranbrook Castle (an iron age hill fort with
    superb views over the Teign valley). IAT? had to suffer verbal
    abuse to stop him going off down the main track where he insisted
    &quot;it is bound to go&quot;. As this would have sent him around
    the trail the wrong way it might well have been a good thing.
    The check at the Castle caused multiple confusion and eventually
    involved a complete circle. I wonder if Poll Tax will be charged
    on the Castle? I'm sure a case can be made out by our Council
    spy.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Down beside the wall on Cranbrook Down we went
    and then across Uppacot Down before finally entering the woods
    across a quite disgusting mire. A complicated gate/wall combination
    provided a challenge to both Mimi and Minder who were doing battle
    trying to get over - looking at them doing this you get the impression
    one has too many legs and the other hasn't enough brains. <BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">By fits and starts we descended through
    Whiddon Wood to the river. This is where it all began, IAT? and
    HT2 (keeping strange company) checking a path along the river
    were called back by Deadly. IAT? claims not to have heard him,
    well one does switch off when he opens his mouth. Dynamite, Fred
    and I, who were ensuring that there was someone at the back,
    were short cutted up the hill only to get lost around a fallen
    tree. The pack came up to find the route and we all trekked back
    through Hannicombe Wood, having to negotiate a number of fallen
    trees that the hare had omitted to remove. And back up the Fingle
    Bridge track to the cars. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Of
    course IAT? wasn't back and the hare sensibly said he wasn't
    going out to find him. Has anybody ever found him? Against our
    better judgement HT2, Endo and myself (well he was my lift) walked
    back to look for him. Cries of T-O-O-N-N-Y-Y just brought back
    echoes of 'tony' from across the valley, the wild animals of
    the wood shifting uneasily as they realised we were back again.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">But what was happening to the subject of this
    hash mag? By dint of close questioning of IAT? and and an interest
    in anthropology and behaviourial science a reconstruction has
    been made. Deserted by HT2 down by the river he proceeded in
    an easterly direction until the path petered out. Retracing his
    steps he got back to the check to find that everybody had disappeared.
    Realising that he would not catch up if he followed the trail,
    he went back along the sawdust towards the start. Back up the
    hill again, through the woods, across the gate/wall, across the
    mucky bog, back across Uppacot Down, up Cranbrook Down towards
    the Castle until he was standing on the very ramparts of the
    defences, whereupon he lost the sawdust. His torch was still
    working, he was but<BR>
    three hundred yards from the cars, indeed only two hundred yards
    from the track back to the cars. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Success
    was staring him in the face - one false move and he would be
    on the slippery slope to ruin, ending up</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">as a mindless babbler forever going on
    about his orienteering results, his run over the weekend and
    finally a broken shell rambling endlessly on about the Albaston
    Relays. A reputation carefully nurtured over the years would
    be swept aside, no longer able to hold his head up in the company
    of those who gather in dark corners of public houses. But I do
    him an injustice, this was no mere hasher, of no value to scribe
    or character assassin. Using the inimitable IAT? Lateral Thinking
    he headed resolutely off towards the bright lights of Chagford.
    This brought him eventually to the unsuspecting folk of Uppacot
    Farm. Now, examining the map one will see that<BR>
    there are no trees between these two places, however he claims
    that he had to struggle through a lot of trees to get there.
    He gets a lot more out of hashing than we do!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    The family had settled down for a comfortable evening watching
    television only to be disturbed by this strangely dressed would-be
    hitchhiker carrying an ancient cow horn trumpet. They'd probably
    moved out to the country to get away from this sort of thing.
    Having listened to his highly unlikely account of why he was
    there, they undoubtedly decided that the best thing was to do
    as he said and give him a lift in their car to get him out of
    the way as fast as possible. So, there ensued a quick trip to
    the Sandy Park Inn to release him into the interior. But, just
    as the 'Good Samaritan' was attempting to make his escape, lo
    and behold his passenger is back again complaining that no one
    in the pub would give him a lift back to his car. The poor chap
    must have thought he was going to be stuck with IAT? for the
    rest of the night! Meanwhile, of course, the meat and two veg
    had been delayed, but after the last imbroglio there with Rudolf
    and a dog fancier, the publican had had the forethought to put
    us in the back room. This is becoming a habit! <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">So, IAT? eventually got back to his car, and after
    a quick change returned to the pub to collect his plaudits. But
    as for me, I'm still out in the bloody moors shouting T-O-O-N-N-Y-Y
    and the echo's still coming back 'tony'. That and the owls. One
    time in the Yealmpton area he claimed to have been following
    the calls of owls, and so if he was still doing this he could
    be anywhere. Of course, when I get back to the cars there was
    nobody there. I start walking, and in fact had nearly got back
    to Uppacot Farm. Now if I had gone in there to ask for a lift
    it could well have been the last straw for the poor chap.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">You only get IAT? on Monday nights, I play golf
    with him as well, and it's taking a lot out of me.</FONT></P>
