     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Just over fifty years
    ago, Winston Churchill was declaring over our wireless sets (well,
    at least on Deadly's set). &quot;I expect that the Battle of
    Britain is about to begin. Upon this battle depends the survival
    of the Christian civilisation&quot;. Funnily enough, when I heard
    this again recently, it reminded me of some previous runs by
    IAT, and especially the 'Bedford Bridge Affair'. Survival is
    paramount when preparing oneself for his hashes: On this occasion,
    I checked the Meteorological Office for wind direction, possible
    fog and anything else I could think of, including snow, and decided
    the risk factor was probably variable.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I am
    reminded of at least six previous occasions when IAT has :-<BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">1. Tripped me up in order to pass
    me, so that I cracked my sternum on a tree trunk.</FONT><BR 
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">2. Used me as a bridge to cross a river.</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">3. Made me hopelessly lost on a foggy, moonlit
    run three winters ago when following him because of mistaking
    his Kermit the Frog winter-wear for a moving swamp.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">4. Subjected me to join a Search Party on the
    Kitley Estate in the snow in an attempt<BR>
    to recover his brain.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">5. Puzzled me by leaving wheelmarks instead of
    blobs of sawdust on a run, until I <BR>
    discovered he had laid the run using a wheelbarrow to carry the
    sawdust in order to save time.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">6. Caused me to witness his probable demise down
    a mineshaft, when he was saved only by a string of barbed wire.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">I was, therefore, delighted when
    the MASH Hash plus ten others (forty in all) set off from<BR>
    Cherrybrook Bridge on what can only be described as a surprising,
    well blobbed run. As an elite short-cutter, the entirity of a
    run is always an unknown quantity to me. I am<BR>
    reliably informed that it went into Bellever Forest on the slopes
    of Lakehead Hill. <B><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"></B>I recall
    that it was whilst short-cutting through the brashings with Wendy,
    I felt the<BR>
    strong call of nature. Mimi, in his ever present roll of Guardian
    Angel (at least, I think it was him who had wings last week)
    to the Slow Elite was skirting the edge of the forest calling,
    in a mating-call type of voice to Wendy (or has he recently taken
    out a life insurance policy of mega bucks on her life?). Whilst
    my call of nature was being fulfilled, I whispered to Wendy &quot;Distract
    Mimi for a couple of minutes, will you?&quot; What<BR>
    did she do? Yelled &quot;YOO HOO, MIMI! Don't come over here!!&quot;
    and WAVED BOTH HANDS AT HIM!! By which time he was about six
    inches from my feet, like a bull charging a red cape from a matador.Thank
    you, Wendy. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">We then went across
    the road up to Arch Tor, down to Powder Mills in a figure of
    eight around Powder Mills Farm, back to Powder Mills where Dumbo
    and I had decided to put the world to rights while waiting for
    the Elite, and back via a bog that claimed not only Angie Hotfingers
    but a couple of others. I hate to admit it, but I nearly enjoyed
    the run. God, I feel thick!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    <B><BR CLEAR="ALL"></B>The on-down appeared to be at the East
    Dart Hotel in order to avoid a confrontation with Tamar Valley
    H3. Speedy food was provided, but little in the way of gossip.
    Deadly was in obvious pain from his achilles as I managed to
    pinch at least six of his chips before being pinned to the table
    with his fork. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">I was about to
    enjoy my own food when I was suddenly aware of a low level, impromptu
    Committee Meeting in the shape of Mimi and someone else kneeling
    at my feet. Had he come to check my undies, I thought. No, it
    was to ask if I wanted to buy a black vest with writing on it
    - unfortunately, he didn't say what writing. He tried hard to
    convince me that by having a <I>black</I> vest I would show up
    more easily on dark runs now that the winter is approaching!
    He then mumbled something about being poised at his telephone
    for the next two days awaiting my call. Did he ask everyone,
    or is he trying a fashionable coup to rid himself of the Grand
    Mistress (moi) in order to streamline the Hash? Luckily, his
    food arrived and as Deadly was moving rather closely to his chips,
    he then retreated. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Hotfingers,
    on a fashion note, was sporting a very smart outfit, but was
    usurped by a toyboy hasher in a very fetching multi coloured
    job. My attention was then drawn to Bart. He held a pint of beer
    at shoulder height in his right hand, and proceeded to dangle
    the fingers of his left hand in it. &quot;What on earth is he
    doing?&quot; I asked his friend of two weeks'. &quot;That's his
    bird chatting-up line&quot; he sighed. &quot;They all ask him
    &quot;What are you doing?&quot;. Well, in giving it ten out of
    ten for originality and nought out of ten for hygiene, I have
    to say it was entirely successful, judging by the response from
    Wendy, HT2, Dumbo, Friend of Dumbo, even Digger, Rudolph, Endosperm,
    IAT, Limpalong, Mates, Rover, Wimpers, Snakehips, Yesman, Ducky,
    Paul, Denim, Stitch, Mike, Anne, TT2, Neil F, Basic Simpson,
    Diesel Simpson, 16v Simpson &amp; Turbo Simpson, Linda, Rod &amp;
    Charlotte not forgetting Minder. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Deadly
    was attempting to solicit Yokelbonker's medical expertise and
    Mike B. was heavily engaged in food. Son of IAT (SIAT) looks
    as if he could audition successfully as Oliver Twist. I wondered,
    in a lucid moment, which is becoming more lucid, if in fact it
    was a SIAT run and that IAT only pitched up as token support.
    In fact, the more I think about it, I am now convinced the run
    was laid by him, hence the high quality.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">What a splendid fellow Limpalong is, and how
    fortunate for all of us that the local Council has ground to
    a halt now that no-one is paying their poll tax. It means he
    can play with all their redundant computers and while away the
    odd month by producing such wonderfully explicit charts, although
    I'm not sure I really want to know 'Who Did What With Whom And
    Where And When'. And WHY, Limpalong, were my bike hashes not
    counted? And WHAT was everyone doing on the 18th June, Run 344
    at Shipley Bridge when we only had twenty four runners? I must
    look in my filofax..........</FONT></P>
