    at Wembury car park and twenty one eager, panting Hashers full
    of vim and vigour awaited the onset/onslaught (delete that not
    applicable) of a Yesman/Rover special. However, as we arrived
    we had to take the salute at a parade of non-hash vehicles and
    inhabitants as they left, with some emulating Steve McQueen and
    others Reginald Molehusband (who?). It really was such a shame
    they all departed so quickly - I was sure we'd catch someone
    having their suspension checked out. Still the assembled company
    can now be remembered as Drake H3 The Nookie Nobblers!.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">On On! was the cry and Yesman led the pack up
    over the hill while Rover lurked suspiciously at the bottom (strange
    how he's acquired this aversion to inclines since the Karrimor
    Mountain Marathon!).The trail headed along the South West Coastal
    Footpath and the hare succeeded in wrong footing Les, Deadly,
    Endo and Sheila at the first check. They all thundered on towards
    Newton Ferrers, everyone hoping that Deadly would act the lemming
    (or should it be lemon?) at Season Point but, alas, the bulb
    in his head lit up and he about turned. As for Endo and Sheila
    ........?? They were next seen in the 'Odd Wheel' - and the Jock
    in me wants so say &quot;Wheel, that's odd&quot;. Something strange
    happened to Les who was also caught out. He missed everyone turning
    back and was reputedly observed running up and down the slope
    from the car park - perhaps he was trying to escape!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The Keenies gradually sorted it all out and cascaded
    down Church Road to rendezvous with a numb Rover (comments not
    required nor welcome!). The check at this point seemed to be
    causing a few problems - maybe the permutations from five possible
    routes was just too much for ordinary mortals - so the pack was
    sent along the path to Ford.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">I think it was at this point that the first grumblings
    of discontent were aired, something about lack of sawdust, I
    believe. Chief Whinger does not require identifying and to be
    honest I would have eaten my jock strap if he'd found anything
    pleasant to say, but if he's nothing (else), he's consistent
    - bless his Rivington Pikes! Anyway, sawdust was laid in quantity,
    enough to fill four dustbin liners and I always thought the object
    was to find the sawdust not have it laid out in a nice, neat,
    visible straight line. Perhaps in future we sould use long lengths
    of 'dayglo' tape to ensure the less intrepid amongst us don't
    stray too far from the straight and narrow!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    On On, along the well churned horse, cow, I'm Not Norman track
    to exit on Ford Road and another check. Deadly and F.Ferret did
    the decent thing and checked out the public footpath towards
    Knighton (How did they know it passed the 'Odd Wheel Inn?) but
    once again they were wrong and Woodenlegs<B> </B>sussed the correct
    trail leading into Church Wood.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">After much meandering and climbing this track
    led the pack onto Ford Road where Snakehips, complete with an
    Arthur Scargill patented you-can't-see-me headlamp, came across
    Rover sitting in the middle of the road. He considered this a
    miner irritation! Up the hill to the T junction where a check
    wrong footed F Ferret, the trail leading to the left down the
    road peeling off right into the woods. After much checking, cursing
    and whingeing a procession of lights led out of the Enchanted
    Forest and onto the run-off down to the coast path. A naughty
    piece of deceit half way down succeeded in getting the pack to
    enter a cul-de-sac like sheep into a pen - but then Hashers should
    be ewesed to subtle subterfuges such as this!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    On the coastal path a check had been totally erased by someone
    or something, but, even still, Rover managed to persuade some
    hashers onto the beach for the long haul to HMS Cambridge. An
    intricate loop was missed towards the end of the beach so the
    pack were directed up the field where two checks were quickly
    overcome to lead all and sundry up a track towards Spring Road.
    Before this objective was achieved however, a further piece of
    deceit succeeded in sending the Keenies hurtling up towards HMS
    Cambridge's gatehouse (would the guards have been amused or amazed?).<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The trail led us along Spring Road, peeling off
    right down a farm track to a check, which we correctly negotiated,
    and then took the rabble down to Yesman, who, pretending to be
    a doorman, directed us to a stile over which lay a field of bulls.
    Not many people realised it, so the sedatives must have worked.
    Dog-end and John would have tripped over them anyway, their eyes
    having that glazed look one usually associates with cadavers
    (who said they were dead from the neck up!).<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Out of the field and a much-decimated pack (the
    faint of heart being pointed towards the cars) ran back along
    Ford Road up the (steep) hill and a right turn into Church Road.
    The Keenies misread a check and headed for home whereas four
    stalwarts, I'm Not Norman, Deerhunter, Woodenlegs plus Rover,
    completed the final loop along Brownhill Lane and a multitude
    of pathways to exit above the church and home.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The Odd Wheel Inn and the Ruddles County beer
    were on form, with a pleasant hour being enjoyed by all. Deadly
    was unusually mute. Yesman formed a huddle with Cream Soda to
    discuss the (mis) fortunes of Plymouth Argyle football team and
    later formed one with I'm Not Norman whence the conversation
    was of such a nature that whispering <BR>
    and secluded corners was the order of the day. Perhaps they were
    discussing where Endo and Sheila got to?? Dog-end and John decided
    they'd better do it together next time. And above it all Slurper's
    laugh could be heard - being mistaken by some as an audition
    for the cauldron scene in Macbeth! I wonder what tickles her
    fancy???</FONT></P>
