    A lesser scribe might start their hash mag thus:<BR>
    &quot;Only a <I>bird-brained</I> hasher would <I>chicken</I>
    out of a run in <I>Bantam</I>. However, Drake hashers don't need
    to be <I>egged</I> on, they know it's the ideal place to <I>lay</I>
    a trail. The weather might be <I>fowl</I> but could stay <I>cooped</I>
    up when offered a f<I>ree range</I> over the South Hams countryside&quot;.
    Now a lesser scribe might consider this type of opening to be
    a <I>feather</I> in their cap, but this scribe considers it<I>
    ineggscusable</I>, especially as Bantham has an 'h' in it (Self
    indulgent - moi?!).</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Modern day Bantham is
    just like something out of Poldark or Treasure Island. The only
    difference is that now that the local smugglers and wreckers
    are called entrepreneurs and are given government grants to help
    them with their businesses. Consequently, as we neared the start,
    it was not too surprising when our car headlights picked out
    a strange hunched figure slowly swinging a lantern to and fro
    whilst muttering incoherently. Could it be 'Old Black Pew' trying
    to pass on the 'Black Spot'? No, it was old Black Bart offering
    to show us a parking spot.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It was a strange band
    of hearty hardy hashers who had assembled outside of the Sloop
    Inn. Wimpers, resplendant in a multi-coloured pair of running
    tights, resembeld the Pied Piper of Hamlyn. As the run involved
    high cliffs and deep water, wise hashers made a mental note not
    to follow him. Cat-Man-Do appeared wearing a fetching brown balaclava.
    It certainly suited her, but shouldn't the face hole be at the
    front? A squeal of brakes and the smell of burning rubber announced
    the arrival of Endosperm and HT2, fresh from their successful
    completion of the Bittaford to Bantham stage of the RAC Rally.</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;On
    On&quot; was called and we set off down a road which led out
    on to some low sand dunes. The hash proceeded to split up and
    dash about aimlessly, scattering rabbits in all directions. It
    is rumoured that the rabbits may soon be evicted to make way
    for a luxury 'retirement warren' for a mystery TV personality.
    Speculation is that it's for Gus Honeybun of TSW fame, who has
    been pensioned off now that Westcounty TV has taken over the
    local television contract. Of course, it goes without saying
    that Westcountry Television is known as WC TV because its output
    is a load of crap.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">By now it was becoming
    clear that this run was subtly different to other hashes, possessing
    a character all of its own. We were at a loss to know why, but
    after much scratching of heads and deliberating it was finally
    suggested that it might be because there was no sawdust. Apparently,
    the hares, Bartman and Catwoman, had spent five hours the previous
    day laying the trail in the teeth of gale force winds, but the
    sawdust was nowhwere to be seen. Deadly was sceptical that any
    had been laid at all and came up with his own highly original
    explanation of how the hares had spent their time. Other expalanations
    involve hungry lemmings, rapid coastal erosion snd self destructing
    sawdust. However, it seems likely that the 'sleet' storm we encountered
    was really a sawdust storm.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Whilst the rest of the
    hash disappeared in the opposite direction, Bart directed a small
    group up the coastal path. When we stopped to admire the view
    on a headland we surprised a fieldmouse out for an evening stroll.
    It was identified by a process of elimination; it wasn't a house
    mouse - there was no house nearby, it wasn't a dormouse - there
    wasn't a dormobile nearby, it was in a field so it must be a
    fieldmouse. Buy the Drake H3 Guide to British Wildlife in your
    shops now! Far below could be heard the Surf and the incoming
    Tide - the sea is full of detergents these days.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">After
    a brisk trot across the cliff tops, Wimpers could be heard calling
    'On' some way behind. Several hashers wanted to wait, but once
    Deadly knew who was calling he insisted on running on as fast
    as possible. What are fiends for?! Further along the coast Limpalong
    became Slipalong and ended up falling headlong and landing on
    a bush. If it had been Kate Bush instead of a thorn bush he wouldn't
    have minded, although she might have. Eventually Thurlestone
    golf links were reached where the hash joined up together again.
    After passing the Thurlestone Hotel Cat-Man-Do directed several
    hashers over a narrow wooden bridge, across a field and out on
    to a road. Julian took the opportunity to explain what he believed
    to be the latest development in hashing, involving strategically
    placed hares shouting loudly and minimal sawdust. This is not
    new, however, as it has been extensively used by your scribe
    for several years on his runs.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It is always possible
    to calculate the amount of time spent on a road as it is in direct
    proportion to the amount of Deadly's whingeing. Consequently,
    the road section must have taken quite a while. Eventually a
    check was discovered with a trail leading off along a narrow
    pathway. Your scribe duly investigated and found an 'X' at the
    end, which he took to mean check back. Wrong! Apparently, what
    it really meant was 'you'll be wrong to stop going in this direction'.
    The hares had designed the check to test the psychic faculties
    of hashers. This was a silly thing to do, as it is well known
    that hashers have no faculties whatsoever.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As a
    result of the above administrative mix up a select band of hashers
    was treated to an extensive tour of the roads around Thurlestone.
    After running up, down and around, the evening was enlivened
    by passing a pack of rabid Rottweilers, which Heinz, ever the
    optimist, suggested might be sausage dogs. He may have been right,
    as they sounded the sort of dogs that might turn you into sausages!
    Endosperm then took charge and directed unerringly towards somewhere,
    although he wasn't quite sure where. At last we stumbled over
    Thurlestone village (it didn't hurt that much). Here a tired
    and emotional Deadly wanted to stop and telephone for a lift
    back to the Sloop. The rest of the group wanted to continue running,
    but at this Deadly got even more upset and finally started to
    cry! Yes, it's true - he cries orien-tears! From Thurlestone
    it was less than a mile back to Bantham, where sawdust was discovered,
    and the hash was reunited.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Apart from Drake H3,
    there were few other people in the Sloop (it must have been a
    good night for wrecking). F Ferret who had arrived back early
    and had ensconced himself in the corner, was tucking into a large
    meal. He was rather put out as he had ordered an ele-fish but
    had only received a jumbo cod. Apparently, he had known all along
    where the trail was going to go. Unfortunately, the hares had
    not and so had laid the run on land. Bwana had done a route of
    his own, which involved running down to the beach then spending
    the rest of the hash climbing up a cliff, thus inventing the
    sport of hash climbing. It's rumoured that the next trail he
    lays will be at the Dewerstone Rocks.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Benji's Mum made it known
    that as long as she has had a good run out she doesn't mind if
    there's no sawdust or if she gets lost. This attitude shows the
    true spirit of hashing, but it could also explain why she joined
    Drake H3! Bart pointed out that HT2 was the only person to do
    the whole run. Perhaps him having hold of her collar all eveing
    might have had something to do with it. Ht2 could be seen examining
    deatils of 'The Three Peaks' race which she says she would like
    to take part in. It seems that the event involves sailing, fell
    running and finding out who killed Laura Palmer.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Yakkidah
    explained that after arriving late for the start Bejabbers had
    seen our lights and told her to catch up with us, whilst pushing
    her out of the car, not even giving her time to change. She also
    mentioned that he might have stopped the car before pushing her
    out. Cream Soda said that during the run he was 'on' for much
    of the time...............on his own that is! He also complimented
    the hares on doing such agood job of looking after him. It's
    amazing how drunk you can get on a half pint of Guinness. Slo-Jo
    must have been 'Down Lambeth Way' recently as she appeared wearing
    Pearly Queen's hat. Presumably this is the first assignment in
    her 'Cockney For Beginners' course.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Cat-Man-Do,
    Slo-Jo, Deadly and Wimpers were seen to be indeep conversation
    with a non-hasher (don't the hash rules say something about this?).
    Whoever he was, he ceratinly seemed to be popular as Cat-Man-Do
    and Slo-Jo were calling him &quot;Darling&quot;. It became obvious
    that he was extremely popular when Deadly and Wimpers called
    him &quot;Darling&quot; as well! Limpalong purchased a bottle
    of Eku 28, supposedly the world's strongest beer. This must be
    the Eku we hear so much about - the new European currency, circulated
    by the Central European Bottle Bank. The bottle was doggedly
    guarded by Rover all evening but somehow he forgot to inform
    the owner that it was in his possession. How absent minded of
    him.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In a blatant attempt to hush up the scribe
    Cat-Man-Do offered to buy me a drink. In order to preserve the
    integrity of the press (!), I politely declined. I don't like
    Domestos much, anyway. Deadly brought the level of conversation
    down to the level of the gutter (what can you expect from someone
    who eats mule), by making various lewd comments abour a fourteen
    inch power tool which Slo-Jo has recently acquired. He also revealed
    his masochistic tendancies by explaining how much he enjoys being
    beaten. Maybe that's why he goes to so many orienteering events.</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The
    Sloop Inn contained a large picture of the Virgin Atlantic Challenger
    signed by Richard Branson and his crew. This is obviously kept
    to impress customers, but now the Landlord can go one better:</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Impressed
    Customer: &quot;I see you had Richard Branson here in 1986&quot;<BR>
    Landlord: &quot;That's nothing, I had Drake in here last week!&quot;</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Finally,
    thank you to Cat-Man-Do and Bart for their efforts in laying
    the trail, which were unfortunately frustrated by extreme weather
    conditions. We still enjoyed the run. I mean this most sincerely,
    I really, really, do!</FONT></P>
