     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It's finally happened
    after twelve years: The weather beats Drake H3, and with the
    new committee just in place. Going downhill already!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">Balmy, damp, Plymouth was a world away from Trowlesworthy
    Warren, where several inches of snow and half a blizzard made
    driving an interesting experience. No other idiot will turn out
    tonight methinks. Wrong! At 7.20pm through the snow came the
    nutters; first Sub and Tinks followed by Rover for his second
    run in five months (he knows how to pick them!), then Anoni and
    Mudflaps. Tinks put us all to shame by emerging from a warm car
    to have a brisk scamper in the snow. Nobody joined her.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    At 7.28pm the hares arrive and skid to a halt. Fluff Diver jumps
    out: <B>&quot;</B>I DIDN'T THINK ANY EFFING IDIOT WOULD BE OUT
    ON AN EFFING NIGHT LIKE TONIGHT BUT THOUGHT I'D BETTER CHECK
    AND HERE YOU ALL ARE, IT TOOK ME AND HEINZ FIVE AND A HALF EFFING
    HOURS TO LAY THIS YESTERDAY, IT'S EIGHT MILES LONG AND YOU CAN'T
    SEE IT, I'M NOT RUNNING IT TONIGHT, YOU PLEASE YOURSELVES, I'M
    OFF TO THE PUB!&quot;. At 7.29 the hares slip/slide away at high
    speed. For once we agree the hares have got it right and follow
    them.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Two pints of 'Royal Oak' later I knew I had made
    a wise decision, and am bold enough to berate that spineless
    wimp-out, Zippy, who had come straight from home to the pub with
    Gnasher and Medlock. He was doing his 'Heavy Stud' bit for the
    benefit of the barmaids, who remained singularly disinterested.
    Yakki, who half made it to the start, turned up with hash mags
    and a new address list. She is obviously taking her 'Hash Dogsbody'
    role very seriously, to the extent that she and Heinz are going
    to replicate this week's aborted run for Run No.640. Watch this
    space.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" FACE="Arial"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"></FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Mudflaps
    had raised the ire of the owner of Vixen Tor (one of life's more
    sensitive souls) with the trail of three weeks ago and had to
    placate her with cakes, chocs, sherry etc etc. Maybe Snakehips
    can list the sensitive areas in a future hash mag - and then
    I won't mention catching him sneaking out of the Royal Oak pub
    at 7.40pm after a two hour session!</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     FACE="Arial"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"></FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Royal Oak beer certainly makes people
    chatty: When Rover was halfway through his second pint he announced
    he was going for the 'Tom Cat Op.'. This was greeted with some
    mirth and unkind sniggers given the ages of his offspring (seventeen,
    fourteen, four &amp; one year). Surely his wife just needs a
    bolt on the bedroom door. Anoni revealed he'd had the 'unkindest
    cut of all' years ago and has enjoyed a very relaxed life since.
    Mudflaps didn't hear any of this but Tinks did, and it was sufficient
    for her to reveal that Sub is falling down on the job. He hasn't
    produced the goods for ten days and didn't seem to be interested,
    in fact, it seems he would just as soon settle for another Guinness.
    Zip offered Tinks his services but she wasn't interested - she'd
    seen it before.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" FACE="Arial"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"></FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">On
    the way out of the pub someone pointed out that this year's committee
    had already exceeded last years in one aspect at least: After
    one week it still had a GM! But watch this space if the lottery
    comes up..............</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" FACE="Arial"><BR

    The old git has rejoined Tamar Valley Hash House Harriers - snow
    bound roads at Princetown had nothing to do with his absence,
    it was all those comments in last week's hash mag that finally
    did the trick!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><I>STOP PRESS:
