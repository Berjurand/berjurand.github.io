    was a real whiff of worry when Fluff was telling us about last
    Monday's run. She didn't think it was long enough, and that she
    was inexperienced at trail laying. Big hearted Deadly, everyone's
    friend, said he would tell her if it was a load of crap, in the
    same friendly way he told dozens of former Drake H3 hashers.
    She needn't have worried because she and Muff laid a blinding
    trail, even though we've gone from Norsworthy Bridge so many
    times before.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Although it was
    a good run, it is true to say the hares were helped by the mist,
    which meant that as soon as we left the river bed and did a couple
    of loops, I for one (the most important one), was lost. It was
    so misty that at one stage Cream Soda and IAT were leading. Sub
    said he was knackered, and Tinkerbell said she was &quot;bimbling&quot;
    - whatever that means. Heinz and Begorah had inside information
    and between them seemed to pick up a lot of the restarts. Snakehips
    claimed to know where we were all night, so why didn't he find
    the trail?<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">After these exertions it was back to the Skylark
    fast beer outlet, except it wasn't for Zippy who hadn't run,
    and was drinking Coke and not eating; something about being in
    training. I thought it was time he got my views on diet and this
    doesn't involve eating less of everything. In fact doctors and
    nutritionists recommend you eat much more fibre. Fibre makes
    you shit. There's a lot of fibre in real ale. That's why it makes
    you shit so much. Curry contains fibre too. Combine a night of
    beer drinking with a curry and you'd probably be crapping all
    day. That's because of the special combination of fibre. Zippy
    wasn't convinced that Friday and Saturday on this would enable
    him to win the Axe Valley Grizzly race. He said he would get
    fat. Bollocks, I say. Fat makes you fat (obvious really, it would
    be a stupid name for the stuff if it makes you thin). Fat is
    loaded with calories and is linked with heart disease. Happily,
    beer contains absolutley no fat whatsoever. Drink as much beer
    as you want and you won't consume any fat. Rover said he was
    going to give this a try and got stuck into a lot of Bass. Endo
    thought there was a competition and joined in. Remember fellas,
    if you drink beer the bottom falls out of your world. If you
    drink Bass the world falls out of your bottom. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">Apart frcm Algy getting in the way and tripping everyone
    up, the main event of the night was the poll taken whether the
    subs should go up frcm 60p to &pound;1 per week. Now I know the
    committee is all female, God bless them, and they do go about
    things in a different way, but I object to democracy on the hash,
    it smacks of pinko tendencies, proportional representation and
    Tamar Valley H3. In fact I'm not sure we need a committee at
    all and we should reduce subs. Four of us voted against any increase;
    it would have been five but IAT was having a shower. He's now
    leading a can't pay won't pay campaign, supported by those other
    stalwarts Cream Soda and Rover. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Wild
    Bill and Skippy had their heads together. She told me later that
    she'd always thought he was a gentleman but he'd told her the
    one about the three hashers: There was an Englishman, a Scotsman,
    and a Japanese, out hashing in the wilds of Kalimantan, when
    they came across a lost tribe (the hashers themselves were lost,
    could this be Plympton H3?). The headman came up to them and
    said that, unless they could prove they had twelve inches between
    them, they would be boiled and eaten. The hashers were taken
    back to the tribal village and told to drop their hash shorts.
    A few minutes later, after having been examined, they were back
    on the path, running as fast as they could away from the village.
    &quot;It's a good job I had six inches&quot;, said the Englishman.
    &quot;And it's a good job I had four inches&quot;, said the Scotsman.
    &quot;Yeah, and it's a bruddy good job I had an erection&quot;,
    said the Jap!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
