     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our future Lords and
    Masters in Brussels get a slight feeling of unease on Monday
    evenings - it's not something they can put their fingers on but
    it causes them to become petulant and produce directives determining
    the lengths of pencils (translated into twelve different languages,
    and causing another fifty hectares of forest to be cut so that
    all full and associate members and all their staff can receive
    their copies). No, the broad sweep of human affairs pass us by,
    whilst we are concerned with the minutiae of our own existence
    - this was one of those nights - we each had our private sorrows
    to reflect on afterwards. As the Fferret said in the car park,
    to the small collection of hounds who had at that time returned,
    &quot;Come next Monday, we'll be on a hat trick&quot;. By the
    time you read this you'll know if the hat trick has been achieved.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The start was as inauspicious as usual, a bitterly
    cold evening, a clear sky which gave one the opportunity to check
    on the North Star from time to time as part of ones survival
    drill (IAT? uses a bright star in a different constellation as
    his North Star - it's usually in the south east quadrant).The
    hare had used an open top Land Rover which gave us a clue as
    to his state of mind. Deadly started whingeing promptly at 7.29
    and 30 seconds. Tamar Valley H3 love him for his little ways.
<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">We set off when he became intolerable for what
    was to be an act of revenge from one of the Milton Combe Mafia.
    When I ran with Tamar Valley H3, the standard rule for runs from
    the Elephant's Nest pub was to go up the road, off right down
    the overgrown track for the check back and then carry on up the
    road. We did the same but there was no check back. One was encouraged.
    <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">The first check was at the right
    angled bend, chaos ensued with a lot of unnecessary climbing
    over hedges. On On was believed to have been called by a group
    off to the left but they were called back by the hare who then
    proceeded to wade across a large pond in the belief that we would
    follow. We all went back over the hedge and through the gate.
    I think we have future Grand Master material here but he shouldn't
    make it so obvious. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Further checking
    ensued, even by me - will I never learn? By the time I realised
    I hadn't found the trail everybody had disappeared except Yesman
    who said the pack had gone back up the lane. We ran back nearly
    to the road and stopped in a gateway to look for lights and listen
    out for voices. Floating across the night air came the call of
    a flat duck, or maybe the flat call of a duck, way back where
    we'd come from. If I take out a Trustee Savings Bank account
    will you stop doing this to me Chris?! <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">A
    hash with just the two of you tends to lack something (other
    people, mainly), and so we returned to the corner and this time
    discovered sawdust off to the right. Finding one blob per field
    for the first three fields but nothing after that, we made our
    way to the sound of hounds, and the duck, only to come across
    a sort of deep leaf. Skirting around this we suddenly found ourselves
    amongst the rest of the pack, all in various state of complaint,
    but more consistently about lack of sawdust. We weren't complaining,
    it had allowed us to catch up. Sod the TSB account!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Things proceeded as normal with the hare finding
    the trail from the next two checks with some difficulty. With
    three large dogs amongst the pack, Jimmy, Hicks and Minder-Binder,
    the various stiles and hedge crossings were proving to be the
    major hazards. If one were unfortunate to be trying to climb
    over with the three of them at the same time one could rapidly
    become a cat lover. We came out to the road within sight of the
    tasteful green Elephant's Nest pub sign, but there was enough
    sawdust to lead us off left towards Axna. Hicks and the other
    two Mafiosos claim not to have seen the sawdust and went straight
    to the pub. Were they forewarned?<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Near the stream at the bottom the sawdust led
    left into a field with a resident bog - the front runners were
    well through and past by the time we arrived. After letting us
    savour its delights, Mimi called us back to continue up the road.
    By the time the keenies caught us up and passed us they were
    whingeing strongly with Deadly muttering at the top of his voice
    about rules! Not Norman in particular was going on and on about
    having to go through the bog twice - I think he's going soft
    - it was only up to his knees. I think he's going to need watching
    and if necessary pushing.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">We came out to the moor and the Long/Short split.
    In the normal course of events the fitter hounds take the Long
    (or all of us if Thumper's wearing those tights) and those with
    IQ's discernible on any scale take the Short. On this run a mixture
    was achieved on each, except for IAT? who found himself abandoned
    in No Mans Land. Just as he was about to set off for the lights
    of cars on the Okehampton road (and then where?), Deadly passed
    by, shortcutting back and took him in tow. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">The long runners headed off north to points unknown
    whilst we shorts followed sawdust up and around to the right
    to a large arrow pointing downhill which must have been the 'On
    Home' sign with three quarters of a mile to go. Coming out to
    the road I was all for going left but the Fferret, who was passing
    at the time, assured me that we needed to go right. His run each
    week is usually of a highly individual character only occasionally
    merging with the rest of us. This run was made for his style.
<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Back at the bucket thoughts upon the run were
    flowing freely: It now seems that runs should be judged on a
    scale of minus one to minus ten instead of one to ten. Not Norman
    was still going on about his bog -he just can't get enough enthusiasm
    to do it more than once. </FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Hounds gradually trickled
    into the pub. Woodenlegs must have stopped for a Freemasons meeting
    on the way because she had forgotten to roll her trouser leg
    down after it. Is she an undercover policewoman? Rover brought
    out his map of the Karrimor Mountain Marathon run in the Cheviots,
    with his route marked out. This was a mistake as Deadly and Snakehips
    told him where he should have gone. The rule is - exaggerate,
    lie or libel but don't produce the evidence. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">It was noted that the hare had not returned but we
    are trained to remain calm in these circumstances, although a
    slight cheer was raised. We settled down to our drinks, chips
    and warm fire. Minder-Binder had returned and Dumbo and Rudolph
    ventured the opinion that he wouldn't return without Mimi. I
    think we tend to underrate our four footed friends at times.
    It was only when the GM went around collecting the money and
    it was realised that Mimi had not paid, that a search party was
    raised with any conviction. Alas he was found some three hundred
    yards from the pub with some weak story about looking for Minder.
    He confided (will they never learn?) to Deadly that he had had
    to ask at a farmhouse to find out where he was. He couldn't find
    the sawdust!</FONT></P>
