    CLEAR="ALL"></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Having
    travelled half way across Devon (some to the musical accompaniment
    of the Hash Horn) to get to this P.K. run at Sandygate, was it
    too much to expect a hash rather than a long &quot;boring&quot;
    road race? I shall omit to mention the other hare on the basis
    that no one could possibly want to share the blame for this disastrous
    run (Incredibly, on a similar debacle in the past from that hostelry
    known as the George, someone actually <I>wanted</I> to claim
    the 'credit' - how else do you think George got her name?!).
    And to make matters worse tonight's hash was a joint run with
    Ashburton H3, so we can't even keep quiet about it!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">This run (race) started off Fast and Furious with
    checks that did little, or nothing, to stop the pack from becoming
    well spread out. Ash Hash were most concerned about their slower
    hounds. We of sterner stuff didn't care a fig, of course. Rambo
    from Ashburton H3, anybody remember him? (anybody want to?) was
    observed cooling himself in a brook. Didn't he realize that H.T.
    had relieved himself in it less than two hundred yards away?
<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">After a bit of damp grass which lulled us into
    thinking this just might turn out to be a good run, there came
    the Long / Short split. Now, what happened to those on the Short
    who knows, as for those on the Long no more can be said, suffice
    to say Wimpers comment of &quot;boring&quot; is somewhat diplomatic
    to describe the worse run in Drake H3's history. Some had said
    H.T.'s run after the Gispert Gallop was the 'pits', well this
    run has got to be a strong contender. Well done P.K., we'll award
    you something, but don't hold your breath!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    The On Down was more interesting, particularly as Deadly wasn't
    there, apparently he was in Norway in a Vauxhall rather than
    a Fjord. Chip-nicking was in evidence, as and when the waitresses
    guard was down. But nicking chips from a member of the public's
    plate by an Ash hasher was embarrassing. The fellow took it all
    in good humour, but he couldn't do anything else with forty odd(!)
    hashers looking on.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">And who was it who couldn't tell the difference
    between Deerhunter and Norman because both were running side
    by side wearing similar running kit? Well, Norman is the bald
    headed one who grows his hair long in a vain attempt to cover
    it! The Trough, in his usual disgusting way, was seen flashing
    in the car park, and when Morris Minor complained he gave her
    car a wash in the only way H.T. can. Apparently, it does take
    off all the grime and you too can have your car (H) T.cut for
    the asking.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Ash Hash invited Drake to their run the following
    night. Seven turned up and apparently a good run was experienced.
    Only ten yards of road was encountered and P.K. was there, so
    hopefully he's taken note. A beer keg was produced halfway into
    the run and after everyone was suitably refreshed it was ON ON!
    The evening concluded with a barbecue and a tug-of-war. Needless
    to say Drake lost - even against the ladies. It's as well they
    all went home before the kids challenged them. It doesn't bear
    thinking about if they lost against the kids!</FONT></P>
