    CLEAR="ALL">The Scribe<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Talking
    about funny sounding names, one of these pieces of paper contained
    suggestions from Limpalong for hash narnes for New Keith and
    Paul, but as we never take any notice of Limpalong's suggestions
    I propose we carry on ignoring them in the hope that he will
    stop making them. He wanted to call New Keith, Hannibal, for
    reasons too boring to go into, and change Paul's name from Thirstyglass
    to Glasshopper. Personally I prefer the former, and as for New
    Keith, let's keep that and call Limpalong Old Keith!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Thirstyglass says his marriage hasn't changed
    anything, except that now he's doing it legally. He's also getting
    up in the middle of the night to have a 'Pea'.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">The other piece of paper was a map of the hash run
    which was given to me by HT2 in the forlorn hope that I would
    write about it in the hash mag. I did have a quick look at it
    but as it consisted of a circle of red arrows I was no wiser
    than I had been on the run.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The start was at Lane End, Hornden but Skippy
    and I had noticed, as had others, blobs of sawdust and an arrow
    in the vicinity of Mary Tavy so there was much apprehension that
    the trail would be a repeat of Drake's five hundredth run. Zippy
    and Muscles arrived with what appeared to be a back seat full
    of dogs, but there were only three dogs plus Groupie. The hares
    arrived ten minutes late which meant that Mimi, who always arrives
    ten minutes late, was on time for a change.<I> </I>Why he had
    deserted Tamar Valley H3 for the night was not revealed. We can
    only hope that it is not permanent. As usual, I was not in a
    position to comment on the run once again struggling in the rear
    trying to keep in touch with Mudflaps and Skippy and ahead of
    Cream Soda.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">At the Elephants Nest
    at Horndon hashers made up at least three quarters of the customers,
    and a couple in the minority were sitting in the corner looking
    thoroughly bemused by the invasion. Eventually they could keep
    quiet no longer. &quot;Who or what are you?&quot;, they enquired.
    &quot;We think you are either on a dog agility training exercise
    or auditioning for the next production of The Hound of The Baskervilles&quot;.
    Not wishing to be thought of as weirdos, we hastily explained
    that we were hash house harriers who had spent the last five
    hundred Monday nights following sawdust trails. This encouraged
    the couple to suggest all sorts of alternatives to the norm i.e.
    not norm, like laying aniseed trails for the dogs to follow.
    People like this could give hashing a bad name!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The Albaston Relay race raised its ugly head.
    Cream Soda's team was being designated as the C3's (isn't that
    the classification for those who fail the medical for the forces?)
    - how appropriate. However, Cream Soda objected to this and we
    are now to be known as The Rejects. Somehow this doesn't sound
    any better. Cream Soda is running, and I use the term loosely,
    the last leg so that at least no one has to wait for him and
    we can all go home. HT2, Skippy and Muscles have been training
    for the relay and they invited me to join them, and I must say
    I was tempted. However, to run in the Albaston Relay is one thing
    but to train for it?!!!</FONT></P>
