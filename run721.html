    There is some curious attraction about Norsworthy Bridge which
    seems to exert a strange pull on yer average Drake hasher. Hordes
    of them there were, like moths around something very attractive
    to moths. Even a truck load of dogs and a horse turned up. The
    horse quite sensibly headed off at the first opportunity. There
    were a worrying number of people carrying torches. Those without
    casually pretended it was all part of a carefully judged decision
    to leave them behind and silently prayed that Anon would not
    produce one of his marathons. The old farts contingency ( no
    names etc.) were wondering aloud which of the Nosworthy permutations
    we were in for tonight. Interrogation of Mudflaps revealed that
    &quot;I was only the donkey and had no idea where I went&quot;
    There was a silence whilst we mentally wrestled with this interesting
    visual concept and were only rescued by a timely and prompt departure.<BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Now the good thing about a Drake
    sized large turnout is that it ensures a relatively gentle start.
    None of this manic lunging uphill . Anon had thoughtfully laid
    plenty of checks as we gradually worked our way up Newleycombe
    Lake to the tin workings. Of course I soon spotted his double
    double bluff, as I noticed did Rudolph, using the little known
    Von Schiser-Scrotwarblebaum gambit of ploughing straight through
    the whole lot. We then refused the bait of the treble double
    double bluff to cross the stream. This resulted in ending deep
    in a gully further up, realising that we had fallen for the quadruple
    double treble bluff and missed a fine oportunity for SCBing lower
    down. Bugger. Even worse, emerging from the depths it appeared
    that the main body of the hash was miles away across the tundra,
    rapidly vanishing into the gloom. I pounded after them but after
    20 yards decided to rest. Medlock and Sarah cruised past. At
    least I would not die alone. To cut a long story short, after
    many weeks of hardship and adventure we caught up with everyone
    at Down Tor. Like the darkness and the midges the mob then descended
    to the cars.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">I followed some mad
    hasher from Tamar Valley H3 on his knackered old Triumph to the
    Royal Oak where he promptly tried to flog everyone &pound;10
    tickets to go drinking with the Tamar Hash. Grief -would they
    pay a tenner to come drinking with Drake? Certainly no-one in
    Drake H3 would. Snakehips probably couldn't afford it anyway
    since he had just spent the entire weeks housekeeping on a pair
    of running shoes of excessively contemporary design.<BR CLEAR="ALL"></FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Ferret
    was grinning widely relating the tale of Zippy, who took up Ferret's
    uncharacteristically generous offer of free holiday accommodation,
    drove five thousand miles non-stop to Ferret's chateau, arrived
    totally unanounced to find it shuttered and barred, (Its owner
    having departed but one and a half hours earlier (ho ho). The
    subsequent insertion and extraction of a stethoscope (sans anaesthetic)
    by his co-driver apparently made Zippy's eyes water.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">Tinkerbell carried out her rounds, Stasi fashion,
    with 'the list' ; one of her victims being the hapless Sarah.
    The poor girl's protestations and denials counted for nothing
    in the pitiless grip of the hare raiser. For this crime, seeing
    she has not yet been christened, she may now be known as 'No
    Way Lay'. On a more serious note may I urge you all to to vote
    Yes on a most important constitutional matter. <U>Yes</U> to
    a drink every week for each hasher. <U>Yes</U> to Deadly paying
    for it.~Yo.</FONT></P>
