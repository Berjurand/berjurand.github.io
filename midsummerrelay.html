    of Drake H3, during their more lucid moments, may recall Zip's
    New Year's eve run around the perimeter of Dartmoor - a distance
    of about 76 miles which took him 18 hours (apparently he stopped
    to go shopping on the way)l A plan has been hatched..<BR CLEAR="ALL">a
    DRAKE HASH relay of the route! Something along the lines of a
    midnight start around midsummer's day in 2001, kicked off by
    the keen/ stupid runners carrying a baton to be<BR>
    passed on throughout the run.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Runners can join the run and run as many or few
    legs as they wish with legs of length and difficulties for all
    abilities from Zip to walkers. The aim will be to finish by around
    6.00pm in the evening with a bbq or something similar at a suitable
    location - suggestions are the Plume or Meavy village hall. Accommodation
    should be available either camping at the Plume or sleeping bags
    at the village hall. The event could be used to raise a bit of
    money for a local/Dartmoor based charity, with perhaps even press
    coverage......Fame for DH3!!!! <BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">At least one mini bus should be available for
    support and transporting of runners during the day. If YOU are
    interested please contact Plodder, any suggestions welcome. This
    is an opportunity for everybody to take part.......(providing
    IAT doesn't head off towards Exmoor muttering those familiar
    words,&quot;It must go this way&quot;).</FONT></P>
