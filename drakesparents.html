    Sorry, I'll rephrase that, some of Drake H3's <I>original</I>
    members. The picture was taken on 23 November 1998 at the Skylark
    at Clearbrook on the occasion of Farting Ferret's last official
    run with Drake before he left to go to live in the south of France
    (no, it wasn't something we said that made him leave). These
    people were either with Drake right from the first run on 23
    January 1984 or joined shortly thereafter. Thanks to them we
    have something which actually makes Mondays worth looking forward
    to! So here is a hash biography of Drake's parents:<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1"
     FACE="Arial">Deadly<BR CLEAR="ALL"></FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Deadly got into hashing through his friendship
    with Wimpers. Both were keen orienteers and so when Wimpers took
    up hashing with Tamar Valley H3 he invited Deadly along. Being
    a fanatical off-road runner, it didn't take very much tarmac
    to upset Deadly. When Tamar Valley H3 had a hash up on Dartmoor
    which consisted of a triangular run all on <I>roads</I> it was
    the final straw. Not being one to keep quiet about such things,
    he voiced his feelings in a very forthright manner, which, apparently,
    so upset the female hares that he and Tamar Valley parted company.
    He found his natural home with the newly formed Drake H3. It
    can be fairly said that through his outspokenness (his whingeing
    was legendary - see the hash mags!), he more than anybody is
    responsible for ensuring that Drake H3 runs are all off-road.
    Deadly was a very fast front runner and maintained this well
    into his fifties. Unfortunately, in 1998 injury caught up with
    him and he retired from running. It is rumoured that he has been
    seen out cycling and that he is hoping that one day he will be
    able to do without the stabilizers on the bike.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
