     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As the appointed hour approached a healthy
    number of hardy hashers assembled at Norsworthy Bridge. The hare,
    advertised as 'Who Knows' (nice name for someone, don't you think?)<B>,</B>
    turned out not to be a new hasher, but none other than Begorrah<B>.</B>
    On the dot of 7.29pm, he led off smartly with a crisp &quot;On
    On&quot;.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">It was a cold and windy night, with rain threatening
    - parky as they say up north. Not Norman was there dressed in
    summer gear, and whilst sheltering behind a rock watching some
    keenies working at a check, received an inspection of his nether
    regions by Dishy. &quot;That's my willy&quot; he declared. &quot;Well,
    it's so small and shrivelled in these conditions, I can't make
    it out&quot; she replied, &quot;and that's a fact'.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">There was a lot of descending going on. Yakki
    was descending on Thirsty Glass, only to hear; &quot;I don't
    want to lay a hash missus&quot;. But almost instantly, to their
    mutual surprise, Thirsty Glass was also descending on Yakki.
    Perhaps he wanted to do another sort of laying. Later on, his
    light went out - serves him right!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Snakehips had made it to the hash for a change
    - nomally he only manages the pub. He was posing as usual. IAT
    was clearly unwell. Firstly he was at one stage in front; secondly
    he did not give the hare even a mild rebuke never mind the normal
    bollocking; thirdly he was there at the end, and a search party
    did not have to be called. Sarah was going well . She took one
    of the long splits, and it was not by mistake. Apparently, she
    has been training. Dianne Modahl watch out!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">Actually it was a bloody awful PROFESSIONALLY laid
    hash, just the sort of thing you'd expect from this hare. People
    were kept running all the time at their various speeds, with
    no opportunity for more enjoyable activities. You can see he's
    a teacher. It stands out a mile. I have no record of other sleazy
    activities. And sleaze is what the voters want, isn't it?</FONT><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL"></FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Back
    in the pub, there was no sign of Dishy and Mole. Apparently they
    have had a baby which weighs several pounds, is black, white
    and cuddly, and whose barking keeps them up all night. Miss from
    Tamar Valley Hash House Harriers had been on the run, forgoing
    her 300th run with TVH3 - apparently they keep detailed statistics
    - how boring. She said she kept up by taking all the shorts (so
    <I>that</I> is where they went - I thought everyone was taking
    up nudism!). Drake must be slipping, what we need is macho hashers.
    Come back Zippy - all is forgiven. Miss's man, Hobo, made it
    to the pub, but had been otherwise engaged with his scouts on
    mountain bikes earlier on - that was his story.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Sue, Andy and Tim were there, moaning at the
    lack of imagination of DH3. They come regularly now, but HAVE
    NOT BEEN CHRISTENED YET. Andy has a colostomy bag which burst
    part way round. If you believe that, you will believe anything.
    You could call him 'Endocolon'. Tim might respond to 'Beast',
    but he looked quite innocuous to me. The most popular item on
    the menu was Cumberland sausage which looks like - well, use
    your imagination.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" FACE="Arial"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"></FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1"
     FACE="Arial">Deadly was upset as apparently Skippy was offering
    her favours around to all and sundry. Whatever he thought, it
    was a truly inspired way of collecting the hash subs, as male
    hashers were clustered round her like bees around a honey pot.
    So Deadly and Rover turned their attentions elsewhere, and commenced
    a collective lust of frightening proportions. The object of their
    attentions, a smartly dressed young woman demurely occupying
    a corner with her partner, rapidly lost her composure and departed.
    I sometimes wonder if the Dartmoor publicans have mixed feelings
    about the hashing fraternity - great for a quick buck, but what
    about the long term effect on the locals? Yakki and her C team
    had a last, last, last committee meeting - it has been a great
    year for them. What surprises are in store next Monday?</FONT></P>
