     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">At the beginning of Autumn when there
    is always a question in the hounds' minds as to whether there
    is a need to bring a torch, and there is usually a run that removes
    any doubt they may have had. This year this was that run. It
    also removed any kind thoughts that may have been tucked away
    in a few minds about Maximouth!</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It might perhaps be pertinent
    at this stage to put into words the standard Cream Soda method
    of planning and laying a run - and dealing with the inevitable
    criticism afterwards. The first, and fatal, step is getting your
    name on the Hare List. Someone comes up to your shoulder in a
    dark and noisy pub and mumbles something, and, thinking you are
    being offered a pint you quickly say yes. When this is followed
    up with a date you realise your mistake. But not to worry, it
    is so far in the distant future that it can be safely ignored.
    If you remember, you put this date in your diary marking off
    a recce a week beforehand and the day before for laying it. Any
    thoughts about noting when to get sawdust are ignored. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">The weeks pass blissfully with Monday evenings filled
    with cursing the hares, before, during and after runs. One of
    these Mondays a person with a pen and a scrumpled bit of paper
    will ask you where you are laying your run from, and they want
    to know right now. After careful thought of two seconds you give
    him a location you can remember (and also in the case of Not
    Norman a telephone number as well, as a Grid Reference). You
    settle down happily again with a virtuous feeling of having done
    one's duty for the Hash - although there may remain a little
    worrying niggle tucked away in a quiet corner of the grey stuff,
    in sterner characters this will quickly disappear. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">One Sunday you turn the page of the diary and it
    says 'recce Hash', but as you can think of much better things
    to do, you ignore this. However, the following day in the Hash
    Mag you see your name down as the Hare for next week. But how
    could this have happened? You are unprepared, you might have
    to go to a grandmother's funeral, you think you have to go away
    on that day. The Haremaster seems strangely firm and resolute,
    is this the person you had laughed and joked with only last week?
    The niggle grows to an 'unsettling influence'. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">Come the weekend you realise you won't be able to
    lay the trail on the Sunday as you already have a prior arrangement,
    well golf is a lot more interesting.You plan the Monday so that
    you go out first thing so that you have plenty of time for any
    unforeseen upsets. Monday morning comes and with a whole day
    off you have plenty of time to lay the hash, in fact it would
    be best to wait until mid afternoon so that after laying the
    run you don't have to travel home and then return again. <BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">You potter around in the morning
    and then during a late lunch you realise you only have enough
    sawdust for half a run. This creates a sort of panic but you
    manage to get some, although it means you have to leave home
    a bit later than planned as you forgot to take the map with you.
    You also have to look up the hash mag to check where you are
    starting from. You get there and look at the map - this sort
    of recce avoids all that nonsense about getting wet feet and
    rain down the back of your neck. Realising that time is getting
    tight you cut down on the original plan of where the run is going.
    <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">So this is it, you're standing
    there, in your waterproofs that leak at all stategic points (it
    always rains when you have to lay a run), weighed down with sawdust
    and the mist is coming down so that the map becomes a bit of
    an irrelevance. It is at this time you remember all the old hurts
    you have suffered at the hands of previous hares and the insults
    you have received from the front runners. The loops will go up
    all the steepest hills and back down again, the checkbacks will
    be of a particularly unpleasant nature and the checks will be
    very difficult to sort out, with false trails going on for ages,
    some with crosses and some without (this always infuriates the
    front runners). And of course, this allows the hare to maintain
    a casual pace around the run, arriving at the checks when the
    front runners are spread at great distances in the wrong direction.
    <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">The map, of course, does not
    tell all and whilst laying the run you will stumble across things
    that are as much a surprise to you as they are going to be unpleasant
    to the hounds; deep bogs, precipices and farmyards with fulsome
    shiggy would fall into this category. This is known as fine tuning.
    After about an hour of this your interest will naturally flag
    and you decide to cut the run down further so that you can get
    it finished quicker in time to get a cup of tea in that caff
    down the road. It all comes to an end eventually and you realise
    you have more sawdust left than you would have thought for an
    hour's run. Forget it. If you're going to let every little thing
    worry you you shouldn't be<BR>
    hashing. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">As the hounds drift
    in, the keenies (those with different types of running shoes
    for different terrain), will ask you for some guidance as to
    which they should wear. I ask you! Give them entirely incorrect
    information. On the dot of 7.30 call &quot;On On&quot; in order
    to ensure any late arrivals, even if only by a few seconds,</FONT>
    <FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">never find the run
    or never catch up if they do. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">If
    all goes to plan you will not break into a sweat at any moment,
    you will be roundly cursed by the front runners as they pass
    you time and time again and you will get back in about an hour,
    certainly no longer. This criticism will continue in the car
    park and at the On Down. There will be criticism made because
    you did not go into areas with good running and nice views -
    just tell them that they were SSSI's. I don't know what they
    are, but it keeps the orienteerers quiet. In all cases ignore
    it, a thick skin is essential. You can enjoy yourself in the
    pubs for a while, confident that the Haremaster will only approach
    you again in desperation.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">So, back to Maximouth's run, or Gobshite as he
    is becoming more widely known as. Regrettably he had strayed
    from the guidelines I have noted above. This run from Holming
    Beam, near Princetown, showed signs of having been well recced
    - very well recced. The moor must have bean tramped for miles
    and miles, all of which was used. A nice touch, however, was
    the nearly invisible sawdust, which is always a godsend to the
    slower runners, as the front, runners find difficulty in following
    the trail. A warning, was given about the 'Long' runners not
    going through Wistmans Wood. This is the sort of information
    that the dedicated short cutter thrives on. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">There was a run up to an old pit and a check, that
    was the first of many, that spread us all far and wide. We then
    came down to the leat and the river through some terrain that
    even Goebbels would have hesitated to use. Three crossings of
    the river were sufficient to ensure that most of us had grit
    to run on for the next hour and a half. Extra for those who also
    crossed the leat a few times. This brought us to the Beardown
    Woods and a delightful false trail into the woods and out again.
    Muscles must have known something we didn't, because she took
    off with Katmandu back to the cars at this time claiming she
    had blocked in her car. With this sort of prescience she could
    be dangerous. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">The trail went
    up the hill and by stages down to the Devonport Leat with the
    front runners well wrong to the right and the back markers leading
    the way to the north. The sawdust was lost somewhere along the
    leat but Deadly found it down the hill and off up the other side
    towards Longaford Tor. This seemed like madness to me and so
    I headed towards the footpath leading south, only to find Alistair;
    on only his second run, doing the same. But this sign of intelligence
    was but a shadow, because although way behind, he turned to follow
    the pack. I plodded back to the road still hoping I would pick
    up sawdust but to no avail. As I made my way slowly along the
    road towards the cars, a distant light shone on the Beardown
    Tors hill. I felt a warm glow inside: Here was I a short distance
    from warmth and comfort and there were they about two miles away,
    in the dark, and most of them without torches. The simple pleasures
    are the best. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Apparently there
    were reports of IAT? being found atop a hillside, with a torch,
    but I can<BR>
    only assume that he must have been rapidly abandoned, due to
    his very late arrival at the Plume. It is nice to see him getting
    back his reputation after several years of normality. I can only
    think it was the 'DANGER AREA' notices on the map that attracted
    Maximouth to these parts of the moor, and quite right too. Character
    building stuff, just leave my character alone, though.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">We met up with Tokyo Rose in the Plume of Feathers,
    and it seems she has taken up a Social Membership of the Hash.The
    ties are still strong, though, as she claimed to have got her
    hair wet. This is believed to have occured when she wound the
    car window down when driving along the track out to the moor.
    It has to be said that this type of hashing has its attractions.
    <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Jan of Tamar Valley H3 made the
    mistake of calling in to see us. After some in depth opinions
    from Deadly, about TVH3 she realised the error of her ways. We
    offered Roger to her, if at any time TVH3 wanted to reduce their
    numbers, but the cure was worse than the disease. We missed Hubcaps
    but this was clearly not the night when Algernon<BR>
    Montmorency Clarence Ffothoringay-Smyth (or Goofy for short)
    should be out. I didn't see the Fferrett all evening, although
    this is not unusual. He times his visits to Andorra to perfection.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Once more into the breech dear friends.</FONT></P>
