     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This was yet another Milton Combe run
    with the hares Mimi and IAT? (brains supplied by Minder the Wonderhound).
    As we know an uneasy alliance exists between all three of them
    but principally between IAT? and Minder who frequently fall out
    over who should sit in the middle seat of the car, or even whether
    IAT? should sit in the back. Fellow hares who lay trails with
    IAT? can usually be seen afterwards in a corner of the pub muttering
    darkly. My experience with him is that you just have to be firm
    with him and he's as good as gold (none of that wheel barrow
    nonsense for instance). <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">However,
    on this occasion they quickly fell out over the sawdust blobs
    with Mimi preferring the carefully formed pile with the hand
    three inches from the ground at the moment of release, the left
    leg bent at the correct angle of one hundred and fifteen degrees
    and the head in the alert position. Whilst IAT? goes for the
    more artistic and carefree approach with the sawdust spread casually
    like a mad woman's - well we won't go into that. Suffice to say
    that Mimi felt obliged to act as sweeper behind him. And then
    there was 'THE LADDER'<I>.</I><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">After
    the difficult weeks the Farting Ferret has had lately, culminating
    in the emotional scenes the week before when his torch packed
    up after one hundred yards, he produced a large and bright shiney
    new one and was flashing it at any one who would look. At least
    now when he gets lost he can see where he is is lost. Sue ('Ever
    Ready'), Rebecca's friend, has quickly adopted Hash habits and
    arrived with flat batteries. I offered her mine but it was too
    big to fit, but at least I tried. Just as well because after
    half an hour it drooped and I had to use my back up.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">We were at a distinct disadvantage compared to
    last week in that Not Norman was<BR>
    running with us from the the beginning - he kept on muttering
    &quot;I'm not running up the<BR>
    river again. I'm not running up the river again&quot;. Last time
    we were here we ran up the footpath by the pub, into the field
    and along the road then back down the steep path. The front runners
    didn't believe they'd have to do it again so the checks were
    effective and we ended up back in the village all together (a
    sort of 'warmer into the bank').<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The trail took us back through the grounds of
    the village hall and the Church and off up the footpath to Bickham.
    IAT? had a little local difficulty, in his usual tactful way,with
    one of the residents at this point.The checks were working well
    but a few of us took advantage of a short cut on the track off
    to the left which led us back down to the bottom again to a check
    where we arrived first - this allowed us to take a long check
    back up a steep field, led by Olive Oyl, through a stream, brambles
    and a fence. By the time we got back everyone else had gone off
    down the valley. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Not Norman was
    to be heard complaining vigorously that it was a dry run because
    it didn't come up to his knees. 'Ever Ready' was running well
    and was already cut and<BR>
    bleeding and well muddied and enjoying life - poor girl she's
    got to meet Horse Trough<BR>
    yet. Across the stream we went and back up the hill. By the time
    I got to the top field <BR>
    the main action seemed to be over - the pack having gone round
    the edge of the field and herded up the horses. Whilst Al, making
    an infrequent appearence, suddenly found</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">several very large horses giving him
    undue attention. Keeping his head, he dived headlong over a gate
    suffering only a few cuts and bruises. I found out this in the
    pub afterwards, when our paths crossed in the field he seemed
    to be muttering rather a lot about horses. But that's the nature
    of the Hash, when you find one of the front runners near the
    back of the pack he's usually muttering about something, e.g.
    Horse Trough, torches, sawdust, b----- hares, The Schleswig Holstein
    Question, Horse Trough, Deadly, etc. Al's doing the Paris Marathon
    later this year and if he stops hashing he should be OK.<BR 
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    IAT? was guiding us back markers down into the next valley where
    a double back put me at the front of the pack - which did not
    go unremarked. Fortunately I'm thick skinned. Down below us was
    a stream so there was only one way to go. In trying to avoid
    running up it I banged my head twice on some trees. I'm really
    going to be glad when I stop Hashing. From there it was into
    a field with only the hare, Mimi, able to find the way. <BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">We passed a closely packed herd of sheep which
    John informed us were checking that no one was wearing Wellington
    boots. Over yet another gate, stile or hedge (this run established
    some sort of record) and arriving at the road junction by Buckland
    Abbey. Deerhunter, seeing a signpost for Milton Combe, took off
    with a Short Cutter's eye for the main chance.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">The bloodied but unbowed rest of us had 'THE LADDER'
    to contend with. THE LADDER had been another point of contention
    between the hares - Mimi was outvoted by Minder and IAT? Any
    other way of getting up that bank would have been very difficult.
    Not Norman's suggestion for assisting Hicks was not carried out
    - it would have been painful for Hicks and would have required
    an immediate finger sterilisation. IAT? was the last one up and
    to make it more difficult for Mimi to collect he pulled it up
    afterwards. I'm alright Jack!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Somewhere on the run Dumbo was heard to say she
    couldn't find the knob but hurriedly explained she was talking
    about her torch. I've noticed Chris always looks very tired after
    a run and they do have a habit of returning late, so perhaps
    it was a slip of the tongue.We headed across the field to the
    fence crossing with a horse trough either side, but fortunately
    these were not of the Medlock variety, then back towards Buckland
    Abbey. Taking the footpath through the grounds the pack was still
    well together as were yet more gates. From there it was out to
    the road and back down the hill to the pub for the end of an
    excellent hash</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff">.</FONT></P>
