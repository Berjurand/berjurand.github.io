     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Lee Moor witch 'Old
    Mother Slagheaps' words of wisdom are well known, but despite
    this there was a good turn out of Drake hashers to defy the curse
    (&quot;Curse, what curse?&quot;). Deadly was making a reappearance
    after suffering an overuse injury. Other runners get this in
    their legs - Deadly had it in his jaw. Wimpers was making a welcome
    return, because, or in spite of Slo-Jo's ministrations to his
    bad back.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The On led us down to a flooded china
    clay pit where the Tolchmoor Gate curse made itself felt for
    the first time, as Mimi high-dived off a twenty five foot drop
    like a bunjiless bunji jumper. Amazingly he landed in something
    approximating one piece, only to find himself sinking into a
    mire of china clay slurry. This provided the hash with a good
    deal of innocent entertainment: Mudflaps said that it had been
    worth turning up for this sight alone. Endosperm later reassured
    Mimi that if he had not survived, at least he could die happy
    knowing he had given us all a good laugh. Maximouth also fell
    victim to the curse, but, unfortunately, only landed up to his
    waist in the slime.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A deep gully was the
    next obstacle to be negotiated, and as Anonymouse &amp; Snakehips
    sped towards it, it apperared that they may be going to 'do a
    Mimi'. However, they were both disqualified with two no jumps
    and a refusal. They got off lightly, for the curse claimed Handlebars
    causing him to fall on a rock and roll, which then made him twist
    his ankle (so enabling him to enjoy rock &amp; roll and the twist
    all in one sentence). Later his ankle swelled to the size of
    a pigeon's egg. Coo!</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Turning away from the
    china clay workings we laboured up through Torycombe Wood. Limpalong
    was was running along minding his own business when a tree jumped
    out and attacked him, leaving him with a wound to his lip which
    resembled smudged lipstick (this would get him some very funny
    looks back in the pub). At times like these poetry can offer
    reassurance:</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">'I think that I shall never see,<BR>
    A poem as lovely as a tree,<BR>
    I could even get to like a bush,<BR>
    That doesn't wack me in the mush!'</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As the
    body count mounted, the curse made itself felt in more subtle
    ways by confusing the hares' (F Ferret &amp; Zippy) already weak
    sense of direction. Every time they called On down the trail
    went up and vice versa. As usual, it was best to listen carefully
    to the hares' advice - then ignore it. HT2 insists that Bart
    was also affected because he happily led a small band of hashers
    on a wild goose chase on an old Plympton H3 trail. And they didn't
    even catch the wild goose.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Back out on the open
    moor confusion reigned with hashers scattered all over the hillside.
    The curse's influence was so powerful that on several occasions
    IAT was in the lead, which, of course, made a bad situation even
    worse. When F Ferret was asked how he managed to lay a trail
    with so many loops in it his reply was a masterpiece of Zen philosophy:
    &quot;If you want to lay a loopy trail all you have to do is
    become loopy yourself , then lay it naturally&quot;. No wonder
    he's so successful! Heinz seemed to be having no problem in finding
    the correct trail. He put this down to having the right trainer..............and
    the left one as well. After a detour around some disused china
    clay tips, the hash reassembled at Broomage Farm then there was
    a jolly jog back to the cars. Nice run, shame about the curse.</FONT><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Some
    hashers thought that they were now safe but the curse was not
    yet finished: Benji's Mum managed to lock herself out of her
    car. Luckily someone found a key which fitted the lock and opened
    her car door (it was a good job they had that tin of Spam with
    them). As we drove away from Tolchmoor Gate the evil oppressive
    atmosphere of the place seemed to lift. Have you ever noticed
    in horror movies they always have a quiet bit when the tension
    is released so that the next shock, when it inevitably comes,
    is all the greater? At the White Thorn at Shaugh Prior we entered
    a haven of calm, all seemed well, or was it.....?</FONT><BR 
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Without
    warning came the biggest shock of the night: HASH SUBS UP TEN
    PENCE!!!!! To add insult to injury, it was revealed that there
    would be no run the following week. The hash 'Old Guard' went
    into a huddle muttering darkly, words like 'disgraceful' and
    'unprecedented' were heard, followed by someone asking what they
    meant. Cream Soda, showing the sort of commitment that had made
    him Grand Master, declared that frankly he didn't give a s***
    if there was a run or not. It's good to know that the GM can
    be guaranteed to live down to the standards set by his predecessors.
    All was soon well, however, as HT2 took charge of the situation.
    She waved her magic wand and said the magic words &quot;Izzy
    wizzy let's get bizzy&quot; and Hey Presto!, where there were
    previously no runs two runs appeared out of thin air; a first
    eleven 'Elite' run on Monday and a second eleven 'Dregs' run
    on Tuesday. Was there applause for this remarkable conjuring
    trick? Not a lot!</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Begorrah surprised everyone
    by saying he had been waiting for 'it' all year. It was assumed
    that he was hoping the blonde young lady in the miniskirt would
    take pity and help him out, but instead he was referring to the
    Jan Kjellstrom orienteering event (anyway, he has to wait every
    two years for the other!). Squeaker explained that she was feeling
    tired after spending all week wallpapering her toilet. It now
    looks a lot better, but she wonders whether it was a mistake
    not to leave a hole when wallpapering the seat. Pete, our newest
    member, was surprised when Muscles greeted him as Bill. What
    she really meant was Wild Bill, which is an appropriate name
    because he was 'Born To Be Wild' and likes to ride a Hog out
    in the country - but we won't go into that. F Ferret revealed
    that the only time he will be the last to leave the pub will
    be the day that Zippy refuses to drink a pint that had been bought
    for him. So it looks like he will be continuing to leave early
    for the foreseeable future....</FONT></P>
