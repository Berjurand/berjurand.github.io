     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A characteristically dry night for the
    annual mid-summer Mothecombe run. Limpalong kindly made way for
    road hogs on the way to the car park; he's a most unusual Drake
    H3 hasher - sensible! <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">The regulars'
    cars started drifting in, plus one or two not so regular, particularly
    TTK with George, dogs etc. all looking disgustingly healthy,
    bright eyes, shiny coats and wagging tails. From the sublime
    to........ IAT returned from holiday, tanned and trying to persuade
    Cream Soda to go on holiday with him next year. Jeffrey Archer
    should get a good one out of this. Mimi came into the field at
    speed and attempted to turn AMRII over; Gary sat in the passenger
    seat with a frozen grin - he's got guts that bloke. The hares
    turned up late, Wimpers with a sweat on, which seemed ominous.
    Why the delay starting? Two minibuses arrived: Oh God no, it's
    St Trinians! Olive Oil blanched, Limpalong (Hash Cash) smiled
    maliciously and got their money, which ensured we'll get a Christmas
    party this year.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The start of the run was out through the same
    field as last year, but no tents for Deadly to run through! We
    encountered a check after 200 yards. First little bleeder to
    teacher(?) in whining voice &quot;I thought we were going to
    the beach. How long's this going to last, and why aren't the
    checks measured in metres&quot;. Slo Jo' directed the numerous,
    non checking slow runners on the trail into the wood. Shortly
    followed by another check, where I caught HT2 up to her usual
    tricks. No, not that one, she did that before she started - I
    leave you to ponder what this was.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Along the valley bottom we got a bit spread out,
    both length and breadth. But another Wimpers special check brought
    everyone back together again, for a quick spin round Slo-Jo '
    s Des Res . The sawdust led us up the track towards the farm,
    where we were halted by a stony faced individual who wasn't entering
    into the spirit of things and told us we were trespassing. His
    ample wife was guarding the other track, 100 yards away, having
    quiet hysterics asking did nobody speak English?, as an unHashlike
    silence had descended. Things threatened to take a nasty turn
    when the goat began to get excited. The Hare turned up to smooth
    things over, tricky this, not helped when Mackintosh Read suggested
    to ample wife she removed her top and come and join us. However,
    knowing him it could have been far worse.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    It was up onto the road at the next check. Deadly encountered
    another resident who told him in basic Angio Saxon that he was
    where he shouldn't be. Deadly has spent most of his life there
    though!</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A
    bit of flagellation next, along the side of the barley field,
    into a part of the estate we hadn't been before with various
    Simpsons, Bart, Schweppes soon checking in the wood. Now this
    was a tricky wood with more checkbacks than you could shake a
    stick at. I did a brilliant short cut at the next check, and
    could hear the Hash running parallel with me as we approached
    the river.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">At the river Not Norman smiled and tightened
    his laces which brought tears to his eyes. Straight over we went
    - well most of us. St Trinians couldn't believe it. Yacky tried
    to break an inoffensive rock with her head. Yokelbonker was most
    solicitous. On the far side Olive Oyl, Schweppes and Ferret found
    the checkback up the hill - Olive Oyl falls for it every time.
    Along the river bank Minder lost his human (?) and seemed quite
    chuffed. <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Everyone went back over
    the river except Hubcaps, Sarah, Popeye (back from the dead)
    and Jane who seemed to be out for an evening stroll. Now it was
    here that I realised several notables had been missing for a
    while, chief amongst whom where were the Old Queen and Cream
    Soda. If I was cruel I would put it down to being in the over
    50's club, but its not that, they're just dyed in the crutch
    SCBs! The trail went on and off the beach, finally went off the
    beach, but Endo and I stayed on the beach, and headed for home
    with part of the St Trinians contingent.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Advancing years, and no barbecue gear saw a clique
    of eight skulking in the Dartmoor Union Inn, so what went on,
    or came off at the beach barbecue I know not, but it was a great
    run. At the DU we had a quick PU. Deadly raved over the Turkey
    Pie, Endo had a big brown one. Cream Soda didn't care for the
    chilli. <BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">P.S. It was Endos birthday Thursday so do the
    decent thing and buy him a pint tonight!</FONT></P>
