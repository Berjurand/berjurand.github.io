    hash goes from oblivion to oblivion; not my turn to write etc.-
    someone has to etc.- why me etc. You probably know the rest of
    the all purpose introduction, which gives me a bit of time to
    tell you about the latest visit of Granny Hill (aged 92) to my
    house. You have to hand it to her, she has all her marbles and
    certainly knows when her glass of babycham needs refilling. She
    was very sad to miss the opportunity of running with us last
    Monday, but an Apex return rail ticket to New Milton waits for
    no man (or Granny Hill), and she sadly bade farewell on Saturday.
    She quite liked Teignmouth but I shall save those rather racy
    stories for when you are all grown up. She also missed the Staverton
    and Landscove Show which is a great shame, since our Thomas came
    first in Class 33 (decorated egg, under eight years). Anyway,
    with the summer holidays here (for the lucky few -yes, we know
    you are all stressed out and deserve the rest and you have to
    do marking during the evening), but some of us still have to
    turn up and go hashing even if it is with the 'other few'.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Hobnails, our
    hare for the evening, looked worried, especially since the view
    from his Popemobile showed only Deadly, Rover and Ferret cracking
    rocks between their cheeks and limbering up. Where was our Member
    of Parliament, where were Pan's People, the committee, Elvis
    Presley and anyone else who could talk without grunting? I'm
    sure I've read this somewhere before. A closer inspection of
    Hobnails revealed him to be sitting in sawdust encrusted splendour,
    as a result of doing 50mph in an open top vehicle with a loose
    bale of shavings on the back seat. Rather like those Christmas
    scenes where you shake the glass container and watch the snow
    slowly subside. A very loud thump, not unlike Concorde passing
    overhead gained our attention, but was only Rover, in training
    mode, molesting a wet hole prior to the off. God knows what B******
    Bunny thought (more of her later) on her first foray into the
    physically challenged world of the Drake experience.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Although Hobnails
    did not actually run away, his skill at directing the trail at
    what must be considered a leisurely pace (and I know about leisurely
    paces) was to be admired. He conducted a long and frank exchange
    of views with Dishy all the way to the summit of the stone row
    whilst the longs got themselves all lathered up on a long loop.
    We had previously had some old Druidic bollocks from him in the
    guise of a hint about finding your way home concerning the tallest
    stone lined up with the sun, two naked virgins (obviously not
    from Plymouth) and a trail of sawdust. It sort of worked but
    somewhere along the line I missed out on the virgins, naked or
    otherwise.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">At the Comwood
    Inn our guest B****** Bunny moaned about the unsuitability of
    her name. Deadly and Rover both nodded sympathetically making
    strange clucking noises as they grovelingly agreed, trying to
    to leer and smile at the same time. Rover then proceeded to work
    his way through all the beers as the barrels ran out one by one
    and he rejected pint after pint of the new ale due to cloudiness.
    He, of course, tested them all first. FFerret showed us his impressive
    gut, the sight of which attracted the luscious Morticia (ask
    Ferret) who thereafter lurked nearby, presumably in the hope
    of another sighting and some hands on experience. Things slowly
    deteriorated as the rump of the hash leant against the bar contemplating
    the charms of Morticia, the girl in the interestingly filled
    black dress, and the meaning of life. I blame the hare, global
    warming and Mr E. Nesbit of 41, Orme Crescent, Grimsby. Next
    week- a short and informative account of Granny Hill's week in
    Teignmouth .You have been warned!</FONT></P>
