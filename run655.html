     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Despite your committee's best efforts
    the hash crisis continues, hashes all over the country find themselves
    with membership lists full of surplus hashers who all have to
    be fed and looked after. The rather belated scheme to cull all
    hashers over the age of forty seems absurd when you realise that;
    (a) no one would probably notice that they had gone anyway, and
    (b) I am over forty so you can forget that. The compensation
    package on offer - a free tee shirt and giant economy tube of
    'deep heat' per carcase - has attracted many less-principled
    hashes. I strongly urge that your committee holds out for the
    additional free beanie hat and car window sticker &quot;Hashers
    Do It All Over You&quot;. Let's face it, you only have to look
    at the type of feed that your average Drake hasher has been given
    over the last few years to realise the degree of contamination
    that must have entered the food chain. I blame the hare. Speaking
    of which brings us to Anonymous and his sojourn in the drizzle......</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Extraordinary,
    really, that so many turned up when it must have been obvious
    when they were leaving home that they were going to get wet.
    Awesome respect to Anon for organising a downhill start. We ought
    to have more of these although it was a bit of a sod trying to
    locate flour in the wet. The trail meandered down ........Some
    left shoes in bogs (Skippy's sibling), some threw themselves
    into bogs (Heinz). Thirsty and Old (old) Ferret for some reason
    made a close investigation of an old mine adit but soon came
    out again as they are both scared of the dark and it was too
    narrow to hold hands. A head down shuffle in the driving drizzle
    brought us to the nether regions of Fernworthy where the IAT
    invisible man award was being strongly courted by Deadly who
    promptly disappeared into the undergrowth for the duration. Ah
    bliss, I hear you murmur.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Now I do like
    a good little footpath now and then and the hare had done a good
    job digging out some great little paths despite the Forestry
    Commission's best endeavours to hide them. This brought us back
    to the edge of the open moor and the swirling mist. &quot;Everyone
    keep together&quot; from the the hare in a resigned sort of way,
    full knowing that nobody would take a blind bit of notice as
    they all buggered off into the murk. Most got back to the cars
    ok. But on the way down the road to the pub we passed three sad
    little figures trailing back along the tarmac. Ah yes, Heinz,
    Zippy and Def Ent had been lured by the piskies and a hopeless
    sense of direction onto the scenic route. Apparently we all waved,
    hooted, smiled and flashed our lights. Did anyone stop and offer
    them a lift? Did they conjones!</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Thirsty mused
    that it must have been the overabundance of tallow, gelatine
    and the other thing he could never remember being stockpiled
    that was causing the navigational problems. Apparently you can
    rub it into your chest for medicinal reasons - tallow that is.
    Skippy and Twice-A-Night unfortunately misunderstood this, which
    led to another sticky moment (metaphorically speaking). Certainly
    the tallow and gelatine pie I ordered was very tasty. The landlady
    admitted that she and the chef had a secret ingredient which
    made it so good. Yes, that was rather tasteless (metaphorically
    speaking). <BR>
    I'll get my coat.</FONT></P>
