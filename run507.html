     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Zippy isn't very good at winning races,
    but you can depend on him to come second; something he did once
    again at the Princetown race (The Dartmoor Challenge) last Saturday
    in some ridiculously short time. He couldn't keep this up on
    Sunday at the Devon Relays Orienteering event where he was beaten
    by Cream Soda by SEVEN minutes. However, it was only his third
    ever course, and he did fine on his other run bringing the Drake
    team in fifth. Incidentally, Cream Soda is sixty tomorrow so<BR>
    HAPPY BIRTHDAY BILL!!!!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Endosperm and HT2 couldn't orienteer on Sunday
    because they were at a wedding in matching dinner jackets, each
    with one red and one green sock. Deadly was risking life and
    limb watching the French Grand Prix at a family occasion.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Anyway, on to the Hash. Limpalong had apparently
    boasted that we would go to a part of Burrator that we had never
    visited before. Since for many people the only area this applied
    to was Burrator village itself we looked forward to the hash
    with interest. In<BR>
    the end we went into the woods between the road and the lake
    with its intricate path network, perfect for hashing. Snakehips,
    who had been out cheating that afternoon showed anyone who wanted
    them some cunning shortcuts and Deadly found his own. Have you
    ever noticed that the more Deadly shortcuts the louder he whinges<BR>
    about other people shortcutting? More energy left I suppose!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">As the trail went up to the woods over the road
    I swear I heard Norman asking Mudflaps to watch his nadgers as
    they climbed a fence. We then followed the leat. That horrible
    dog, Ben, jumped into the leat and ran up it trying to catch
    Yakidah, who it thought was in front. Stupid Mutt! Yakidah did
    the same to overtake some hashers and to try to catch up Ben,
    who she thought was in front. In the end we all had to put up
    with the disgusting wet hound squeezing past our legs on narrow
    paths for the rest of the hash.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Back at the cars there was a double quick rush
    to get changed and to get to the pub, not just to be first ,
    but to avoid all the midges. It's that time of year again when
    thousands of the things land on sweaty hashers as they expose(!)
    themselves while changing. They take their fill of your blood
    leaving all their germs and excrement in return and mildly irritate
    you for about a week (and that's just the hares - the midges
    are even worse!). <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">By the way,
    do any of you listen to the John Peel show on the radio on Friday
    and Saturday night? It's on as I'm writing this and is really
    very good. Not very relevant to Monday night though, I'm afraid.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Anyway, after a really good, fast run we went
    back to the Rock Inn, where Maximouse was having a good whinge.
    First he was whingeing about how every time he comes home from
    University for two hashes he has to help to lay one of them.
    Then he was<BR>
    whinging about how crap the beer tastes in the South compared
    to up North. I was so engrossed in listening him that I completely
    missed the story of Slo-Jo and Algie's sausage which sounds intriguing.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Limpalong came and told me that Jenny was complaining
    about her hash name 'Vinegar'. I don't see what can possibly
    be wrong with this harmless substance. Anyway, you're not supposed
    to like you hash name. Just be thankful your not called Yokelbonker!
    Why not rename her 'Toxic Waste' which at least gives her something<BR>
    reasonable to whinge about? <BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">On
    the subject of hash names: Isn't Minimouse now taller than Maximouse?
    Hmmm.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">I'm afraid I can't remember anymore so I'll have
    to pad the rest out with a load of bollocks:</FONT></P>
