     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It is deep regret we
    must report that IAT has not been seen since the Dumbo/Rudolf
    nuptual and his Dartmoor Half Marathon the day afterwards. Was
    it his flamboyant leg-shaking on the dance floor (our attendant
    lady hashers have still not got over this), or was it his spirited
    crossing of our famous moor? His braveness will always be remembered
    - I wonder if he's left his Sunbeam Alpine to Drake H3? Maybe
    they also drive to Hashes without hoods in that Great Bog in
    the Sky.....<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Probably a time starved
    scribe would not have canvassed for pre-Hash info, and so he
    would not then have been burdened with the news of our very own
    Filmstars of Stage &amp; Screen viz. Hubcaps and Deadly.They
    have both been signed up by BBC TV (yes these are facts) - Deadly
    on Panorama's Orienteering For The Over Fifties (or My Zimmer
    Frame Has A Clip Board Fitted) and Hubcaps, whose role is not
    as yet clear... but she was not impressed when a genuine BBC
    stuffed rabbit frightened her Laylah. No - I didn't understand
    this either!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">7.29pm saw us a bit
    damp up in a cloud on Walkhampton Moor. A dripping wet Snakehips
    greeted us with a fiendish grin and sawdust all over his person.
    A sizeable presence of twenty one Hashers with four new chaps
    (Hash names later - very much later!), and the return of Not
    Norman. He reckons he actually hashed in Austria! He said he
    was in a very interesting bog and noticed that it had...an electric
    eye! Then when he stepped backwards....the bog flushed!<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">Well, the Hare's grin was with purpose. Somehow the
    combination of cunning loops with a record number of bogs had
    been achieved. It was dark nearly immediately, which enabled
    the first loop to return us nearly to base, knackered. Anyway
    it was down, on, up, over; the ground was so cunningly set that
    whichever way we went we were on it.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>
    It was getting very close to imbibement time before we found
    the bogs, and we'd only crossed and re-crossed the streams twice.
    However, your scribe had been 'knee-capped' trying to workout
    a leat crossing, so this must be taken into account. It was just
    after the bogs (they were of the most floating and swaying type!)
    that our resident anaesthetist, AYA (Are you Awake), quickly
    decided that his knowledge of Crocodile Dundee was of more use
    than all that medical training, when he was charged by two rampant
    black cows. Immediately he held up his arms ...... and they were
    mesmerised, which was what you might call a stunning success.
    Well, it saves on the Nitrous Oxide!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">I was amazed when the cars were suddenly in front
    of us - and I think F. Ferret was pleased too. He'd been running
    slowly, and had said this was because he had lifted something
    heavy; but what with his recent outward-mobility and that nubile
    young lady <BR>
    he was seen with in the Skylark last Sunday night...<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">A very invigorating run but how did he manage
    to lay it at 6.30 that night?<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">The Plume of Feathers was revisited and they
    switched on the chip-fryer as the first hasher hit the car park.
    Pleasantries were exchanged e.g. Deadly commented on Slurper's
    lovely eyes.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">HT2 started a mix
    'n' match navel competition until we were overwhelmed by The
    Riot.<BR>
    Why does Tamar Valley H3 arrive at 9.30? It is said they were
    so lost that only the best keenies made it to the pub. Are there
    still one hundred and forty two hashers still out there in a
    bog? Deerhunter was pleased at their arrival because he was able
    to distribute (palm off?) the remainder of our Hash Mags.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Garfield was so phased by the attentions that
    Digger (or JCB - the Eddie the Eagle lookalike) was paying to
    his daughter that he refused to deny rumours that he had recently
    received a fifteen percent pay rise. A reliable O.H.M.S. source
    confirms that hash subs will have to be increased pro-rata to
    cover this.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Recently a Drake H3 hasher tried to rescue a
    Tamar Valley hasher from a very wet bog.<BR>
    Desperately he attempted resuscitation by artificial respiration,
    and with flailing arms managed to pump water from the victim's
    mouth. &quot;Come and take over someone!&quot; he cried, his
    strength ebbing. But no one stepped forward until Garfield (a
    self confessed expert in hydro-pneumatics) arrived, and declared
    - &quot;Pull him further out of the bog - you're sucking water
    in at one end and pumping it out of the other!&quot;.</FONT></P>
