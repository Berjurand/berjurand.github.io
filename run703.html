    It is strange how the vagaries of the magnificent British climate
    continue to perplex even weather beaten veterans of the not so
    magnificent Drake hash. Despite the appearance of a clear balmy
    evening from within the confines of the Beastmobile, the reality
    of a stiff breeze reduced the temperature to below what felt
    like the freezing point of a yetis testicles (not my description
    you realise). <BR CLEAR="ALL"></FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Opinion polls suggest that most Drake
    hashers would not vote for frozen testes and that the only true
    test is when they turn up and vote with their feet. Within five
    minutes we witnessed an epic swing of landslide proportions to
    the super cooled gonads persuasion. Amazingly sixty seven percent
    of hashers were heard to say 'brrrrr' whilst a lone independent
    ran round in a circle four times, retreated to a car and refused
    to emerge until the hash was over. This sea change in attitude
    to the cold is something that even Rover's increasingly threadbare
    Union Jack shorts cannot conceal. He must realise that we have
    lost confidence in the ability of this garment to carry out its
    promise to protect us from the nastier side of life and that
    after eighteen years they do not have the energy, vision and
    freshness to take this great hash into the 21st century.<BR>
    </FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Meanwhile
    out on the hustings Rudolph assured us that his intended policy
    of multiple river crossings had been shelved due to the recent
    precipitation. This skill at ditching unpopular manifesto commitments
    did not go unappreciated by the crowd. So, four minutes and thirty
    three seconds late, we started, but who's counting anyway?<BR
    CLEAR="ALL"></FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1"
     FACE="Arial">Now I know that we must maintain the custom of
    slagging off the hares to keep the correctly deficient Drake
    attitude alive and suitably moribund. Therefore the next bit
    must be read with the proviso lodged firmly in the back of your
    mind that all hares are useless, sad, incompetent members of
    an increasingly dysfunctional society who could not manage a
    multi-media conferencing facility on the internet in a computer
    shop if you paid them - but, and this is a big but i.e. <B>but
    -</B> it has to be admitted that this was a pretty hash on a
    clear evening following a wandering route down to Double Waters,
    a loop up to West Down returning to the river for the promised
    foot wetting (for some)- almost slightly enjoyable. Arrghh...
    sorry... forgetting what I'm saying- totally crap route, should
    get some real men to lay a proper hash etc. Which leads, inevitably,
    to the IAT scenario for the evening.....</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The
    saga starts with his car keys which, carefully stashed under
    a wheel arch earlier, have now gone missing. F Ferrets hasty
    departure from the car park confirmed lAT's suspicion that he
    was the perpetrator of this foul deed. Our Grand Master's half
    hour of searching and fulminating was only halted when he realised
    that he had been groping the wrong wheel arch and that they were
    safely on the other side where he had put them in the first place.
    Your comments on a postcard please.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">At the pub they had obviously been anticipating
    the influx of hungry hashers and arranged for their frying machine
    to break down. After I tried to order sausage, fried egg, fried
    bread, fried tomato, mushroom, chips and a side order of warm
    fat, the landlady cheerfully suggested a cheese sandwich and
    lovely green salad instead. The next on down will be at the Buckland
    Temperance Hall. The good news is the fryer works.</FONT></P>
