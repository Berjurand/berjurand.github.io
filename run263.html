    It's cold, it's wet, it's Monday night at 7.30. God knows why
    we do it? Anyway, a dozen or so hardy hashers gathered for the
    delights of<BR>
    New Waste. Included in our midst was Horse Trough, not Mark Two
    but the original. Who's that I hear you cry? Don't worry, just
    some ignorant sod in a flashy B.M.W.<BR>
    who turns up occasionally and causes chaos, then disappears for
    months on end pretending he's got some incurable injury.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Also making a return was that famous vanishing
    act of Mimi and Minder. First it was Mimi's turn to get lost
    on his own run, then last week it was Minder's turn to go A.W.O.L..
    As the story goes, our intrepid Doberman got himself well and
    truly stuffed and spent the night under a Landrover. The following
    morning the owner, taking pity on the brute gave him a lift to
    the local cop shop (what a silly bugger....would you honestly
    give a lift to a Doberman?). Anyway, Minder's not stupid, when
    they tried to put him in the cells he cried the place down forcing
    a kindly W.P.C. to take him upstairs for a nice cup of tea. After
    pawprinting and photographing he was released on bail.<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">I digress, back to 7.30 and after a few mumblings
    we were soon off on to Pound Plantation. After some minor detours
    we were soon over the wall into Grange Plantation. Deadly was
    heard to enquire &quot;How far can we go into these woods?&quot;.
    Quick as a flash came back the answer ..&quot;To the middle,
    after that you'll be going out&quot;. And sure enough we emerged,
    and the hidden sawdust carried us back on to Pound Plantation.
    On to? Well perhaps 'into' would be a better word for it as this
    has to be one of shiggiest areas around. Sod the calling, lets
    get out of here, women and children first!<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">On On to the check by the gate. Here we glimpsed
    our gentler hashers who had missed the previous shig due to the
    late arrival of one of their number. Whilst the more<BR>
    serious of us went out to check, our resident comedian came up
    with such classics as: &quot;What's the fastest string in the
    world?...CONCORDE&quot;, and 'What goes whistling up the isle
    at a wedding?....the bride's train&quot;. (Yawnnnnn!)<BR>
    <BR CLEAR="ALL">Anyway folks, On On was eventually found and
    soon we were all galloping off into the night up in the general
    direction of Stalldown Barrow. As sure as eggs is Edwina's Curried
    eggs, the trail had to come back down - so down it came. Here
    things start to get a bit hazy as being one of the trail blazers
    I went a bit to quick and buggered off to<BR>
    the pub! I am assured by those in the know that the rest of the
    trail was up to the usual high standard which we have all 'got
    used to'. (Even though Popeye and Olive Oyl had<BR>
    crossed words. Evidently on three seperate occasions, whilst
    laying the trail, they could not agree on where to spread the
    two carrier bags full of sawdust. Finally to prove just who really
    wears the trousers Les orders Debbs back to the car whilst <I>he</I>
    battles through the wind and the rain to finish laying the trail!).<BR
    CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL">Eventually, everybody made it back
    to the Mountain Inn, including Wooden Leggs who fancied having
    a quick one at the Cornwood Inn. Soon we were relaxing by the
    fire. Influenza was the topic on everyones' lips (and noses,
    as it seems the whole hash has had it). Maybe that's why Her
    Majesty's (not so) civil servants, Ferret and H.T.2, have stayed
    away. Rumour has it they have both been seen with Plympton H3
    recently!</FONT></P>
