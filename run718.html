    CLEAR="ALL">Due to a reluctance to leave the beach the scribe
    sadly missed the run, although did manage to negotiate part of
    the trail through the Wild Wood, before retreating to the safety
    of the car park. However in the pub the trail's excellence was
    proclaimed by many, especially Snakehips who thought he may have
    been stung by no less than the Greater Hog Weed. This lead The
    Beast and Twice a Week to reminisce about concerts in Plymouth
    Guildhall and whether Peter Gabriel was wearing a marigold or
    bat costume at the time. Other hashers joined in the mood of
    nostalgia; who would have guessed that Sub was a Bay City Rollers
    fan and was eagerly awaiting the return of tank tops?<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR
    CLEAR="ALL">Another group of even sadder / older male hashers
    excelled themselves by sitting at a table directly obstructing
    the ladies toilet, obviously enjoying having to move their chairs
    with a cheerful exclamation of 'sorry luv', every time a lady
    wished to use the facility.</FONT><BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR CLEAR="ALL"><FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Meanwhile Neville, Limpalong,
    Skippy and Yaki where discussing Clearbrook, and suggesting it
    was Shangri-La - a haven for youthfulness. This was due to someone
    meeting a hasher, on a local golf course, who until recently
    resided in Shangri-La, and referred to him as that hasher, you
    know 'O.A.P.' Who was being described I wonder?</FONT></P>
